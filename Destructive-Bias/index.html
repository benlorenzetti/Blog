<h1>Historically Underrepresented Demographic Targeted in Upcoming Election</h1>
<h2>06 SEP 2018</h2>
<p> Following the accidental release of Republican-classified documents by a
	Democratic Senator that show the Republican nominee for Supreme Court is
	not racist, politicians and strategists from across the aisle are scrambling
	to target a historically underrepresented group ahead of the 2018 election:
	literate people. Literate people are people who can read and write.
</p>
<p> "Literate people have never had a voice in this country", says Democratic
	strategist Ben L., noting recent research that
	suggests the founding fathers were illiterate and Abraham Lincoln was actually
	just a notarist who liked stamping thing, like the confederacy.
</p>
<p>"But today the country is shifting,
  buoyed by immigrants coming here and striving to learn English at accelerated
	rates and by the youth, who as early as age 2 are learning to form
	sentences and write college entrance essays. What we really don't understand
	though, is who these voters <em>are</em>, what drives them when they vote
	and how to target them.
</p>
<p> Republicans

		my own and not those of the Department of Defense.

<p> The US is imposing sactions on our own financial entities,
preventing them from future business with Nicolas Maduro's
government in Venezuela;
we accuse Maduro of stealing the vote and his government of
being idealogically opposed to US since his predecessor Hugo Chavez.
</p>
<p>
Some say our sanctions should have been harsher, driving
up oil prices in the US but crippling the Maduro government overnight.
Some say we should do nothing and let Maduro's government
implode without any excusable narrative of US post-imperialism.
But there is also a more unconvential path we could follow.
</p>
<p>
To keep his grip on power, Maduro needs more money than current
oil revenues can afford. Meanwhile private US investors, who currently
represent about 60% of those invested financially in Maduro
(especially Goldman Sachs is in the news) continue doubling down on
the misfortune of Venezuelans and other South American peoples by
lending corrupt, resource-rich governments more money.
</p>
<p> If we believe in our own values and think Maduro
will eventually default and/or become a total dictator,
perhaps a better course
is to preemptively call a default on US investments in Venezuela.
Declare all those bonds junk overnight by some legal authority
that lawyers can argue about, then enforce, and then pass a law about.
</p>
<p> Those pushing American-imperialists narratives would be forced
to admit the facts do not support their case.
Extra risky commodity speculators will have to think twice before
investing in a state oil company or government that rejects American
values. As a minor side effect, the comparative cost of
capitalizing American industries could fall.
</p>
<p> This would probably have to be an executive action;
Goldman Sachs would lobby congress pretty heavily.
Perhaps Trump,
who is famously hated by everyone and claims too rich to be bought,
perhaps he is the right guy to make such a leadership call.
