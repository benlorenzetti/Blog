<h1>Duel Mandate: The Irony and Inequity of the Federal Reserve System</h1>

<p> Central Bankers in and out of Government have more responsibilies

	<li>a general rise in inequality over recent decades</li>
</ol>
<p> This article is a monetarist critique of the discretion power and
	discretionary policies of the Federal Reserve. It is also a
	surprisingly positive prediction of future trends,
	especially with regard to a slowing down of the growth of wealth inequality.
</p>
<article id="dual-mandate">
<h2>1. Historic Discretion of the Dual Mandate</h2>
<p> The Constitution says the Congress shall have power:
<ul>
	<li>To borrow money on the credit of the United States;</li>
	<li>To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,
		and fix the standard of weights and measures;
	</li>
</ul>
and that:
<ul>
	<li>No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of
		appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the
		receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from
		time to time.
	</li>
	<li>No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;
		grantletters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit;
		make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts;
		pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the
		obligation of contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> The gold standard was broken by executive order by FDR in 1933 and
	ended by Nixon in 1971 (a bipartisan affair). At each instance,
	Congress and the Surpreme Court conceded to the executive these changes.
	One can argue this breaking-change leadership was necessary given the
	circumstances or that it was an inevitable result of advances in
	economics, as Keynesians or Monetarist might, but the spirit of the
	constitution where monetary policy was subject to more constraints that
	the whims of bureaucrats was never properly ammended.
</p>
<p> The current mandate of the Federal Reserve from Congress directs:
</p>
<p>
	<em>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal
		Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and
		credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to
		increase production, so as to promote effectively the  goals of maximum
		employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.</em>
</p>
<p> Ironically, this tripartite instruction has come to be known as the
	<a href="https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate">
	dual mandate</a>, i.e. stable prices and maximum sustainable
	employment.
</p>
<p>This faux pas is likely due to the prominance of
	the Phillips Curve and IS-LM model in macro economics and their
	predictions of tradeoffs between inflation and GDP
	(Phillips Curve) and GDP and interest (LM Curve).
	Interest rates are seen as a policy variable to adjust these
	relationships, but virtually ignored is any correlation between
	interest rates and inequality.
</p>

<article id="phillips-curve">
<h2>2. Collapse of the Phillips Curve</h2>
<p> The Phillips Curve is the observed inverse correlation between
	unemployment and inflation, an academic observation on which the Federal
	Reserve's mandate is partially based. However its primacy as a
	policy tool has been reduced since the 1970s due to the observed
	correlation becoming unstable	and due to a critique by Friedman and
	Phelps that
	<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/stagflation-revisited">
	predicted the instability</a> due to changes in inflation expectations by
	the people.
</p>
<p> The instability is clear in a simple CPI based Phillips Curve;
	in the darker points from the 1970s-1990s it looks much more like
	a random cloud than a curve.
</p>
<img src="cpi-phillips-curve.png">
<p> In addition to instability, in the 2000s the
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/what-is-phillips-curve-why-flattened">
	Phillips Curve appeared to flatten</a> as inflation stayed low,
	causing significant concern amoung Keynesian economists and public servents.
	The concern is two-fold, can a flat Phillips Curve still be used for
	adjusting the unemployment rate in recessions and have any other
	misunderstandings, besides the lack of expectations critiqued by Friedman,
	caused the Federal Reserve to conduct counterproductive or harmful policy?
</p>
<p> There is lots of recent research in this area, for example the
	expectation augmented phillips curve equation below is from a
	<a href="https://economics.princeton.edu/events/emi-nakamura/">
	comprehensible presentation</a> on the New Keynesian Phillips curve,
	where &pi; is actual inflation rate, E&pi;
	the expected inflation, and -&kappa;u basically the
	old Keynesian Phillips curve (a slope &times; unemployment rate).
</p>
<img src="new-keynesian-phillips-curve.png">
<p>	In a lot of this research, graphs like the	one below are
	very popular, the idea being that inflation is self-fulfilling,
	that if the Federal Reserve can convince us of its competance at keeping
	inflation at a certain rate, that in and of itself will help make it
	true.
</p>
<img src="inflation-expectations.png">
<p> The self-fulfilling "anchoring" of inflation expectations shares a common
	theme with most Keynesian theories, that the
	people, left to their own market interactions, can produce a
	positive feedback look that must be actively managed by a competent
	authority, in this case for inflation. For example, consider
	Chairman Bernanke's speech on
	<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070710a.htm">
	anchoring low inflation expectations in 2007</a>:
</p>
<p> <i>...Likewise, a lower sensitivity of long-run inflation to
	supply shocks would
	imply that such shocks are much less likely to generate economic instability
	today than they would have been several decades ago.
	Notably, the sharp increases in energy prices over the past few years have
	not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession, in contrast
	(for example) to the U.S. experience of the 1970s.</i>

<article id="inflation">
<h2>3. Inflation Inertia</h2>
<p> Many have been surprised by the apparent success of "anchored" low
	inflation expectations, with inflation even
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2018/why-inflation-so-low">
	persisiting below the Federal Reserves's target rate</a> of 2%.
	However this "anchor" is actually forecastable with a simple monetary-based
	rule.
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021062pap.pdf">
	Why Do We Think that Inflation Expectations Matter for Inflation?</a>,
  Mr. Rudd finds that, if as is frequently done in recent academic work, if
	"<i>the 'true' inflation equation has a role for short-run expected
		inflation</i>"
	and assuming a particular inflation forcasting rule, then:
	"<i>the expectation of long-run inflation in this sort of world will likely
	be self-fullfilling: with a zero unemployment gap and no supply shocks,
	actual average inflation will equal the long-run mean obtained from
	the inflation forcasting rule.</i>"
</p>
<p> Take the tautology money supply (M) times velocity (V) equals the
	average price level of goods and serives (P) times the number of transactions
	in the economy (T), where velocity is defined in terms of the other variables
	but intuitively is sort of like the size of peoples' rainy day funds.
	Assuming velocity remains constant and taking a partial derivative results
	in an equation for expected change in average price levels.
</p>
<img src="mv-eq.png">
<p> This is not very useful, but substituting in variables for which there is
	publically available data, namely expected inflation (E&pi;), population
	growth rate (Qrt), and gross domestic product (Gdp) produces a useful
	relationship between predicted inflation, changes in the money supply,
	and population growth.
</p>
<img src="inf-eq.png">
<img src="expected-inflation.png">
<img src="new-keynesian-phillips-curve.png">
<img src="expectation-augmented-breakout.png">
<p> Comparing the simple Unemployment/CPI Phillips Curve from above vs.
	using this forecasted inflation gap produces a much sharper,
  more stable correlation between inflation and unemployment during
  periods of economic shocks (oil crises, recessions, NAFTA, etc.)
	and a dramatic flattening in 2012 and beyond.

<h2>1. Nominal Interest Rates and the Zero Lower Bound</h2>
<p> Keynesian economics is supposed to be countercyclical; the point of
	having a bureaucrat in charge is to dampen economic cylces, making
	recessions less severe and expansions less booming/speculative.
	In this view, interest rates are one of the central banker's levers
	to strengthen or moderate the economy and therefore correct unemployment
	and inflation.
</p>
<p> Unfortunately, this aspect of Keynesian economics is scientifically true,
	in the sense that it has never been tested. The graph below shows that over
	all six of the last six cycles, and especially the last four, the
	Federal Reserve has never succeeded in returning interest rates to their
	previous level.
</p>
<p> Since the Great Recession central bankers have fretted about nominal
	interest rates approaching the "zero lower bound" (ZLB) because this
	constricted their ability to lower interest rates further during Covid 19
	and future crises. However, it is hard to take a school of thought seriously
	which frets so much about a "problem" of its own making.

<article id="liquidity-trap">
<h2>2. Liquidity Trap</h2>
<p> Yet the come-tragedy continues, instead of being content with lowering
	nominal interest rates to zero and testing the Keynesian hypothesis
	over the entire cycle, central banks around the world have begun another
	experiment, large scale asset purchase programs (LSAP or QE) to temporarily
	lower real interest rates further. Unironically they fret over a
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/april-2014/the-liquidity-trap-an-alternative-explanation-for-todays-low-inflation">
	liquidity trap</a>, where the central bank can no longer influence GDP by
  increasing the money supply because the investments available have no
	higher nominal yields than simply holding the cash.
