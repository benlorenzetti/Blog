<p> This article is a Monetarist critique of the policies and dogma of the
	Federal Reserve and new-Keynesian economics. It is also a positive
	prediction of future trends, especially that wealth inequality will peak.
</p>
<article id="phillips-curve">
<h2>1. The Phillips Curve is Dead</h2>
<p> The Phillips curve is the inverse relationship between
	inflation and unemployment, an academic observation on which the Federal
	Reserve's mandate is partially based. The plot below shows the
	inverse relationship from the US in the 1960s.
	The idea is the Federal Reserve can, to some extent, lower unemployment
	by raising inflation.
</p>
<img src="phillips-1960s.png">
<p>However the Phillips curve's primacy as a
	policy tool has been reduced since the 1970s due to the relationship
	becoming inconsistent	and due to a theoretical critique by Friedman and
	Phelps that
	<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/stagflation-revisited">
	inflation expectations</a> (Krugman), not just unemployment,
	drive actual inflation.
</p>
<p> After the 1960s, no consistent trend appears in a simple CPI-unemployment
	scatterplot; in the darker points (months) from the 1970s-1990s it looks
	much more like a random cycles than a curve. Additionally, in the 2000s
	(copper points) the
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/what-is-phillips-curve-why-flattened">
	Phillips curve appeared to flatten</a> (Engemann) as inflation stayed low.
</p>
<img src="cpi-phillips-curve.png">
<p>
	The concern is two-fold, can a flat Phillips curve still be used for
	adjusting the unemployment rate in recessions, and have any other
	mistakes&mdash;besides missing inflation expectations in the 1970s,
	as critiqued by Friedman&mdash;resulted in harmful or counterproductive
	Federal policy? To keep the dogma alive, research	has focused on quantifying
	inflation expectations and isolating the effects of expectations.
</p>
<p> This	new-Keynesian, expectation-augmented Phillips curve
	is presented well in this talk on
	<a href="https://economics.princeton.edu/events/emi-nakamura/">
	Is the Philips Curve Getting Flatter</a> (Nakamura). In the equation &pi;
	is actual inflation rate, E&pi; the expected inflation, and
	-&kappa;u basically the
	old Keynesian Phillips curve (a slope &times; unemployment rate).
</p>
<img src="new-keynesian-phillips-curve.png">
<p>	In the linked presentation and much contemporary literature, graphs like
	the one below are very popular, an idea that inflation expectations are
	self-fulfilling: if the Federal Reserve can convince us of its competance
	at achieving a certain inflation rate, that in and of itself will help make
	it true. This seems possible but also a very political idea. Here is
	their graph:
</p>
<img src="nakamura-inflation-expectations.png">
<p> This self-fulfilling "anchoring" of inflation expectations shares a common
	theme with most Keynesian theories, that the people produce psychological,
	positive feedback loops that must be actively managed by a competent
	authority, in this case for inflation. For example, consider
	Chairman Bernanke's speech on
	<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070710a.htm">
	anchoring low inflation expectations in 2007</a>:
</p>
<p> <i>
	...Notably, the sharp increases in energy prices over the past few years have
	not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession, in contrast
	(for example) to the U.S. experience of the 1970s.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Various factors might account for these changes in the Phillips curve,
	but, as Mishkin pointed out, better-anchored inflation
	expectations&mdash;themselves, of course, the product of monetary policies
	that brought inflation down and have kept it relatively stable--certainly
	play some role.</i>
</p>
<p> Unlucky timing for that speech...but
	perhaps true.

<h2>2. Inflation Inertia (Long Live the Phillips Curve)</h2>
<p> Many have been
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2018/why-inflation-so-low">
	surprised by the apparent success of "anchored" low inflation expectations</a>,
	(Sanchez and Kim) with inflation even	persisiting below the Federal
	Reserves's target rate of 2%
	(<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w21476">why 2%</a>).
	However this "anchor" was actually forecastable with a simple monetary-based
	rule.
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021062pap.pdf">
	Why Do We Think that Inflation Expectations Matter for Inflation?</a>,
  Mr. Rudd finds that, if
	"<i>the 'true' inflation equation has a role for short-run expected
		inflation</i>"
	and assuming a particular inflation forcasting rule, then:
	"<i>the expectation of long-run inflation in this sort of world will likely
	be self-fullfilling: with a zero unemployment gap and no supply shocks,
	actual average inflation will equal the long-run mean obtained from
	the inflation forcasting rule.</i>"
</p>
<p> Take the Monetarist tautology money supply (M), times "velocity of money"
	(V), equals the average price level (P) of goods and services,
	times the number of transactions (T) in the economy, where velocity is
	defined in terms of the other variables but intuitively is sort of like
	the size of your rainy day fund in the bank.
</p>
<img src="mv-eq.png">
<p>
	Next, assume velocity remains constant and then
	derive an equation for expected change in average price levels.
</p>
<img src="mv-derivative.png">
<p> This is not very useful, but further assuming the number of transactions
	in the economy scales only with population size, i.e. everyone continues
	to conduct the same distribution of transactions in size and quantity, then
	several substitutions can be made to rewrite this equation
	in terms for which there is publically available data.
	Let E&pi; be the monetary inflation rate, Qrt the population
	growth rate, and Gdp gross domestic product.
</p>
<img src="inf-eq.png">
<p> Thus with two assumptions, expected inflation is a function of the
	quantity of money (M) and population growth rate (Qrt).
	Although neither assumuption of constant velocity nor [T &prop; population]
	is necessarily true, the errors produced by both are at least bounded to a
	particular data point period because the equation is based on a
	derivative;	not integration of inflation (or errors) over time.
</p>
<p> Somewhat more difficult is choosing an appropriate measure of the
	money supply, which has been the main critique of Monetarism.
</p>
<p>However, if we narrowly define the money supply as	being the expected
	long-term money supply, then even with an independent
	Federal Reserve, the Federal Government is still a source of "printed
	money" by the Federal Debt because the government, unlike people,
	does not age and will never have to pay off its total debt load as long
	as potential tax revenue scales somewhat proportionally.
</p>
<p> Since this narrow definition of the long term money supply is
	based on the number of dollars available to the people of the country,
	less those that will be unavailable in the future, it must also be
	adjusted for accumulated trade surpluses and deficits.
</p>
<img src="delta-m-eq.png">
<p> How well does this long term money supply and its predicted long term
	inflation fit the recent experience of the United States?
</p>
<p> At first glance, poorly. There are multiple times where
	actual inflation leads predicted inflation in the 1970s and 1980s
	and the predictions of the 1990s and 2000s appear wildly off.
	But after 2013 the prediction becomes accurate.
</p>
<img src="expected-inflation.png">
<p> This regression to predicted monetary inflation in 2013 can be
	explained by a series of real supply shocks having finally
	working their way through the economy, in particular leaving the gold
	standard (1971), oil shocks (1973, 1979, 1990),
	billateral trade with China (1979), NAFTA (1994), other trade agreements,
	and the computer revolution.
</p>
<p> If this were true, one would expect a steep Phillips curve
	(slope -&kappa;) during the period of supply shocks, as
	inflation helped distribute real price changes in the economy, and
	a flat curve after employment prices reached a new equilibrium with
	goods and services.
</p>
<img src="new-keynesian-phillips-curve.png">
<p> The graph below plots a CPI new-Keynesian Phillips curve, but with
	expected inflation for the period (E&pi;) calculated from the long term
	expected monetary inflation described above instead of professional
	prediction surveys. Instead of plotting a output gap, it plots an
	inflation gap
	<span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&Delta;&pi; = CPI - E&pi;)</span>.
</p>
<img src="expectation-augmented-breakout.png">
<p> Indeed, comparing the simple CPI scatterplot from
	<a href="#phillips-curve">above</a> vs. the CPI and forecasted long-term
	inflation gap produces a steep, relatively stable correlation between
	inflation and unemployment during periods attributable to supply shocks
	and a dramatic flattening after 2013.

<h2>3. Nominal Interest Rates and the Liquidity Trap</h2>
<img src="admiral-ackbar.gif" width="240px;" style="float:left;margin-top:20px;margin-right:20px;">
<p> New-Keynesian economics is supposed to be countercyclical; the point of
	having a bureaucrat in charge is to dampen business cylces, making
	recessions less severe and expansions less speculative. At this point in
	America we have come to expect when a recession begins, the central bank
	will lower interest rates to encourage more loans and startup more economic
	investment and construction.
</p>
<p> After 50 years off the gold standard, this central theory remains
	scientifically true&mdash;but in the sense that it has never fully been tested.
	The graph below shows that over	all six of the last six cycles, and
	especially the last four, the Federal Reserve never succeeded in
	raising interest rates to their previous level during the good times.
</p>
<img src="interest-and-inflation-rates.png">
<p> Consequently, since the Great Recession interest rates have been at or
	near the "zero lower bound" (ZLB), which restricts the Federal Reserve's
	ability to further lower interest rates during future crises. The Fed cannot
	lower the federal funds rate below zero in the absense of reserve
	requirements, which ironically the Fed
	<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/0693lead.pdf">
	abolished on nonpersonal time and savings deposits</a> (Feinman) in 1990.
</p>
<p> New-Keynesian economists call this a
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/april-2014/the-liquidity-trap-an-alternative-explanation-for-todays-low-inflation">
	liquidity trap</a>, as defined by Keynes himself:
</p>
<p><i>There is the possibility...that, after the rate of interest has fallen
	to a certain level, liquidity-preference may become virtually absolute in
	the sense that almost everyone prefers cash to holding a debt which yields
	so low a rate of interest. In this event the monetary authority would have
	lost effective control over the rate of interest. But whilst this limiting
	case might become practically important in future, I know of no example of
	it hitherto.</i>
</p>
<p> I.e. negative interest rates don't work very well for the Fed because
	every bank would simply borrow as much as it could, stash the cash in
	a vault, and wait to make a profit when the loan is due because less is
	required to pay it off.
</p>

<h2>4. Real Interest Rates and Secular Stagnation</h2>
<p> Real interest rates, r, are defined by the Fisher equation, where i is the
	nominal interest rate for banks to borrow money from the Fed and
	&pi; is inflation.
</p>
<img src="fisher-eq.png">
<p> A second monetarist critique of <a href="#inflation">"anchored" inflation
	expectations</a>, is a simple assertion: a currency	debased from physical
	commodities, like gold, but re-based on an abstract commodity, natural
	numbers, will have a natural real interest rate of zero.
	Compare the graph used to make the case for inflation expectations with
	a graph of nominal interest rates:
</p>
<img src="nakamura-inflation-expectations.png" width="300px">
<img src="interest-and-inflation-rates.png" width="300px;">
<p> The same initial insight of <a href="#phillips-curve">inflation
	expectations</a>, that inflation follows
	expectations, also appears true of a graph of inflation following interest
	rates! As we <a href="#zlb">have seen</a>, the Federal Reserve has
	consistently failed to restore nominal interest rates to previous levels
	during times of economic expansion. If the natural real interest rate is zero,
	then the Federal Reserve's policies alone would account for the low inflation
	(<span style="white-space:nowrap;">r = 0 &Rightarrow; &pi; = i</span>).
	Ironically stable prices!
</p>
<p>
	However, new-Keynesians would counter this assertion with two arguments:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="">Taylor rule</a>: central banks tend to raise interest
		rates to counter inflation, or lower interest rates to counter recessions
		(which generally have low observed inflation), so the correlation between
		interest rates and inflation is caused by central bank policy, not
		an inevitable result.
	</li>
	<li>Secular Stagnation: natural real interest rates are not
		constant and have been declining for at least four decades, for a variety
		of undesirable factors.
	</li>
</ol>
<p> With regard to the Taylor rule, see the critique of new-Keynesian inflation
	expectations regarding the Phillips curve <a href="#phillips-curve">above</a>.
	It would be ironic if the bureaucrats at the Fed were actually creating their
	own positive feedback loop on inflation.
</p>
<p>	Secular Stagnation, as used by economist today, describes the
	long term fall in real interest rates and its potential causes and effects,
	as discussed in this
	<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/On-Falling-Neutral-Real-Rates-Fiscal-Policy-and-the-Risk-of-Secular-Stagnation.pdf">
	paper</a> by Lukasz Rachel and Lawrence Summers. The following graph
	introduces their argument:
</p>
<img src="summers-real-interest.png">
<p> To combat secular stagnation, Rachel and Summers argue for larger
	budget deficits and increased fiscal programs such as pay-as-you-go old
	age pensions (Social Security) and government health care programs to raise
	neutral real rates. The reason why we should combat secular	"stagnation"
	is considered obvious, but an actual reason why is not given.
	Laubach and Williams, of the LW r* model,
	<a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2015-16.pdf">
	suggest</a>:
</p>
<p><i> Since the start of the Great Recession, the estimated natural rate of
	interest fell sharply and shows no sign of recovering. These results are
	robust to alternative model specifications. If the natural rate remains low,
	future episodes of hitting the zero lower bound are likely to be frequent
	and long-lasting.</i>
</p>
<p> If the motivation is to avoid the <a href="#zlb">zero lower bound</a>
	for nominal interest rates, then there is some irony and insanity here: the
	"<a href="https://twitter.com/lhsummers/status/1164490345759092738?lang=en">post-Keynesian</a>"
	solution to activist monetary policy becoming
	ineffective due to overuse of loose rates over time, is persistently
	looser fiscal policy of deficits for decades?
</p>
<p>	It is also ironic for those of gold-bug disposition that formally leaving
	the gold standard gave the Federal Reserve enough independent power lower
	interest rates to the limit, thus rendering their powers impotent.
</p>
<p> Finally, there is some empirical evidence for the assertion that the
	natural real interest rate is zero, and that this should be considered a
	technological/civic advancement in its own right. Consider this graph from
	Paul Schmelzing in
	<a href="https://economics.rutgers.edu/downloads-hidden-menu/news-and-events/workshops/money-history-and-finance/1823-paulschmelzing/file">

<h2>5. Interest Rates and Inequality</h2>
<p> This criticism of the Federal Reserve's dogma for
	inflation and interest rates has relied on two old Monetary equations,
	the quantity theory of money
	(<span style="white-space:nowrap;">MV = PT</span>) and the Fisher equation
	(<span style="white-space:nowrap;">r = i - &pi;</span>),
	and the evidence provided was based on on derivative data, i.e. looking
	at percent changes measured between specific points in time. This had
	the advantage of removing cumulative creep of errors over time.
	However a third equation is needed to help explain the wealth effect
	of all of these exponential phenomenon: the geometric series (Rn) from the
	<a href="../Real-Estate/mortgage-calculator.html">mortgage calculator</a>:
</p>
<img src="../Real-Estate/mortgage-calculator-summary.png">
<p> For more information, see the <a href="../Real-Estate/index.html">
	mortgage calculator series</a> for assessing real estate prices,
	which found two key results:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Real estate prices are directly related to, and can be predicted by,
		30-year mortgage interest rates.
	</li>
	<li>There is a long term trend of equity prices (S&amp;P 500) trending in
		parallel with these interest rate based prices.
	</li>
</ol>
<p> Both of these can be seen from graphs of real estate price to rent (P/R)
	ratios and stock/real estate price to earnings (P/E) ratios, although there
	are business cycles variations in both.
</p>
<p> In the P/R graph, the modelled P/R ratio is driven primarily by
	mortgage interest rates (entirely in the graph above due to some
	assumptions based on data availability), suggesting that the Federal Funds
	Rate and other less conventional interest rate operations (QE) are almost
	entirely responsible for the rise in home prices since at least the 1990s.
</p>
<img src="../Real-Estate/resistance-ratio.png">
<p> In the P/E graph, the same modelled curve based on interest rates
	is plotted in yellow, except assuming full equity such that	what would be
	a mortgage payment is instead earnings for a landlord.
	The red curve is a more complex model showing the use of mortgage debt
	increases net earnings once
	<a href="../Real-Estate/equity-buildup.html">equity buildup</a>
	is accounted for.
</p>
<img src="../Real-Estate/peratio.png">
<p> Scaling asset prices shown by the S&amp;P 500 does not have a first-order
	impact on the Gini coefficient for wealth inequality because everyones' net
	worth is scaled proportionally, however there would be accumulating effects
	over time as labor income is able to afford fewer and fewer shares of capital
	stock.
</p>
<p> In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUGpjpEGTfE">
	panel talk on wealth tax proposals</a>, Professor Saez introduces the topic
	with first a graph of wealth over time and says that the "weight of
	wealth" in terms of the economy is getting heavier, due to reasons such as
	monopoly rents of large corporations.
</p>
<p> With a second graph, he implies that wealth inequality follows the
	same U-shaped curve:
</p>
<img src="inequality1-pikettyetal.png" width="300px;">
<img src="inequality2-saez-speech.png" width="300px;">
<p> Another measure of the same wealth effect shown in the first graph is
	presented in <a href="https://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2020JEP.pdf">
	The Rise in Income and Wealth Inequality in America: Evidence from
	Distributional Macroeconomic Accounts</a> (Saez and Zucman),
	which is the wealth of the top 1% compared to average incomes
	reproduced in the comparison below.
</p>
<p>
	Comparing this measure of wealth and income inequality with the roughly
	equivalent results of the
	<a href="../Real-Estate/index.html">mortgage calculator series</a> P/E ratio,
	one can see the three-fold increase in the average wealth of
	the top 1% relative to average income coincides with a
	three-fold increase in the price of equity, as predicted by mortgage
	interest rates set by the Fed (yellow and red curves) and observed in the
	S&amp;P 500 (blue).
</p>
<img src="inequality3-saez-zucman-2020.png" width="300px;">
<img src="../Real-Estate/peratio.png" width="300px;">
<p> Future research to quantify this source of the growth in wealth
	inequity needs to be done by the Federal Reserve, especially as
	interest rates are a part of their mandate directed by Congress.
</p>
</article>

<article id="dual-mandate">
<a href="#top">top</a>
<h2>6. The Dual Mandate</h2>
<p> The Constitution says the Congress shall have power:
<ul>
	<li>To borrow money on the credit of the United States;</li>
	<li>To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,
		and fix the standard of weights and measures;
	</li>
</ul>
and that:
<ul>
	<li>No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of
		appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the
		receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from
		time to time.
	</li>
	<li>No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;
		grantletters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit;
		make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts;
		pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the
		obligation of contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> The gold standard was broken by executive order by FDR in 1933 and
	ended by Nixon in 1971 (a bipartisan affair). At each instance,
	Congress and the Surpreme Court conceded to the executive these changes.
	One can argue this breaking-change leadership was necessary given the
	circumstances or that it was an inevitable result of advances in
	economics, as Keynesians or Monetarists might, but the spirit of the
	Constitution, where monetary policy was subject to more fundamental
	constraints than the whims of bureaucrats, was never properly ammended.
</p>
<p> The current mandate of the Federal Reserve from Congress directs:
</p>
<p>
	<em>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal
		Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and
		credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to
		increase production, so as to promote effectively the  goals of maximum
		employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.</em>
</p>
<p> Ironically, this tripartite instruction has come to be known as the
	<a href="https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate">
	dual mandate</a>, i.e. stable prices and maximum sustainable
	employment.
</p>
<p>This faux pas is likely due to the prominance of
	the Phillips curve and IS-LM model in macro economics and their
	predictions of tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment
	(Phillips curve) and GDP and interest (LM Curve).
	Interest rates are seen as a policy variable to adjust these
	relationships, but virtually ignored is the correlation between
	long-term interest rates and inequality.
