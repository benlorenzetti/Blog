<h1>Duel Mandate: The Irony and Inequity of the Federal Reserve System</h1>

<img src="hamilton-burr-duel.jpg" style="float:right;">

<p> Central Bankers in and out of Government have more responsibilies
	and worries in recent years than ever before. Have any of these recent
	macroeconomic trends provided a natural experiment for New Keynesianism,
	Monetarism, or Real Business Cycle theory?

<p> This article is a monetarist critique of the discretionary power and
	discretionary policies of the Federal Reserve and new-Keynesian
	economics. It is also a surprisingly positive prediction of future trends,
	especially with regard to a slowing down of the growth of wealth inequality.

<h2>1. The Phillips Curve is Dead</h2>
<p> The Phillips curve is the observed inverse correlation between
	unemployment and inflation, an academic observation on which the Federal
	Reserve's mandate is partially based. However its primacy as a
	policy tool has been reduced since the 1970s due to the observed
	correlation becoming unstable	and due to a critique by Friedman and
	Phelps that
	<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/stagflation-revisited">
	inflation expectations</a>, affect actual inflation.
</p>
<p> No stable curve is clear in a simple CPI based Phillips scatterplot;
	in the darker points (months) from the 1970s-1990s it looks much more like
	a random cloud than a curve.
	Additionally, in the 2000s the
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2020/january/what-is-phillips-curve-why-flattened">
	Phillips curve appeared to flatten</a> as inflation stayed low, prompting
	significant concern and research amoung public servents and economists.
</p>
<img src="cpi-phillips-curve.png">
<p>
	The concern is two-fold, can a flat Phillips curve still be used for
	adjusting the unemployment rate in recessions, and have any other
	misunderstandings&mdash;besides the lack of expectations critiqued by
	Friedman&mdash;caused the Federal Reserve to conduct counterproductive
	or harmful policy?
</p>
<p> The	new-Keynesian, expectation-augmented Phillips curve
	is presented well in this talk on
	<a href="https://economics.princeton.edu/events/emi-nakamura/">
	Is the Philips Curve Getting Flatter?</a> In the equation &pi;
	is actual inflation rate, E&pi; the expected inflation, and
	-&kappa;u basically the
	old Keynesian Phillips curve (a slope &times; unemployment rate).
</p>
<img src="new-keynesian-phillips-curve.png">
<p>	In this and much contemporary research, graphs like the
	one below are very popular, the idea being that inflation is self-fulfilling:
	if the Federal Reserve can convince us of its competance at achieving
	a certain inflation rate, that in and of itself will help make it
	true. This seems possible but also a very political idea. Here is
	their graph:
</p>
<img src="nakamura-inflation-expectations.png">
<p> This self-fulfilling "anchoring" of inflation expectations shares a common
	theme with most Keynesian theories, that the people produce psychological,
	positive feedback loops that must be actively managed by a competent
	authority, in this case for inflation. For example, consider
	Chairman Bernanke's speech on
	<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070710a.htm">
	anchoring low inflation expectations in 2007</a>:
</p>
<p> <i>
	...Notably, the sharp increases in energy prices over the past few years have
	not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession, in contrast
	(for example) to the U.S. experience of the 1970s.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Various factors might account for these changes in the Phillips curve,
	but, as Mishkin pointed out, better-anchored inflation
	expectations&mdash;themselves, of course, the product of monetary policies
	that brought inflation down and have kept it relatively stable--certainly
	play some role.</i>
</p>
<p> Really?

<h2>2. Inflation Inertia (Long Live the Phillips Curve)</h2>
<p> Many have been
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2018/why-inflation-so-low">
	surprised by the apparent success of "anchored" low inflation expectations</a>,
	with inflation even	persisiting below the Federal Reserves's target
	rate of 2% (<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w21476">why 2%?</a>).
	However this "anchor" is actually forecastable with a simple monetary-based
	rule.
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021062pap.pdf">
	Why Do We Think that Inflation Expectations Matter for Inflation?</a>,
  Mr. Rudd finds that, if
	"<i>the 'true' inflation equation has a role for short-run expected
		inflation</i>"
	and assuming a particular inflation forcasting rule, then:
	"<i>the expectation of long-run inflation in this sort of world will likely
	be self-fullfilling: with a zero unemployment gap and no supply shocks,
	actual average inflation will equal the long-run mean obtained from
	the inflation forcasting rule.</i>"
</p>
<p> Take the Monetarism tautology money supply (M), times "velocity of money"
	(V), equals the average price level (P) of goods and services,
	times the number of transactions (T) in the economy, where velocity is
	defined in terms of the other variables but intuitively is sort of like
	the size of your rainy day fund in the bank.
</p>
<img src="mv-eq.png">
<p>
	Next, assume velocity remains constant and then
	derive an equation for expected change in average price levels.
</p>
<img src="mv-derivative.png">
<p> This is not very useful, but further assuming the number of transactions
	in the economy scales only with population size, i.e. everyone continues
	to conduct the same distribution of transactions in size and quantity, then
	several substitutions can be made to rewrite this equation
	in terms for which there is publically available data.
	Let E&pi; be the monetary inflation rate, Qrt the population
	growth rate, and Gdp gross domestic product.
</p>
<img src="inf-eq.png">
<p> Thus with two assumptions, expected inflation is a function of the
	quantity of money (M) and population growth rate (Qrt).
	Although neither assumuption of constant velocity nor [T &prop; population]
	is necessarily true, the errors produced by both are at least bounded to a
	particular data point period because the equation is based on a
	derivative;	no integration of inflation (or errors) over time.
</p>
<p> Somewhat more difficult is choosing an appropriate measure of the
	money supply, which has been the main critique of Monetarism.
</p>
<p>However, if we narrowly define the money supply as
	being the expected long-term money supply (for expected long term
	inflation), we can conclude that even with an
	"independent" Federal Reserve, the Federal Government can still "print
	money" by deficit spending. The logic being the government, unlike people,
	does not age and will never have to pay off its total debt load as long
	as potential tax revenue scales somewhat proportionally. Conversly,
	as more deficit dollars are provided to the people, the overall prices
	will rise for a given amount of real economic activity, thus increasing
	potential tax revenue.
</p>
<p> Since this narrow definition of the long term money supply is
	based on the number of dollars available to the people of the country,
	it must also be adjusted for trade surpluses and deficits.
</p>
<img src="delta-m-eq.png">
<p> How well does this long term money supply and its predicted long term
	inflation fit the recent experience of the United States?
</p>
<p> At first glance, not very well. There are multiple times where
	actual inflation leads the predicted inflation in the 1970s and 1980s
	and the predictions of the 1990s and 2000s appear wildly off.
	But after 2013 the prediction appears suddenly very accurate.
</p>
<img src="expected-inflation.png">
<p> This shift toward long-term predicted inflation in 2013 is likely due to a
	series of real supply and demand shocks having finally working their way
	through the economy, in particular leaving the gold standard (1971),
	oil shocks (1973, 1979, 1990),
	billateral trade with China (1979), NAFTA (1994), other trade agreements,
	the computer revolution,	and many interest rate changes.
</p>
<p> If this were true, one would expect a strong Phillips curve relationship
	(slope -&kappa;) during the period of supply and demand shocks, as
	inflation absorbed a portion of real price changes in the economy, and
	a flat curve after employment prices reached a new equilibrium with
	goods and services.
</p>
<img src="new-keynesian-phillips-curve.png">
<p> The graph below plots the observed new-Keynesian Phillips curve, but with
	expected inflation for the period (E&pi;) calculated from the long term
	expected monetary inflation described above instead of professional
	prediction surveys; instead of plotting a output gap, it plots an
	inflation gap
	<span style="white-space:nowrap;">(&Delta;&pi; = CPI - E&pi;)</span>.
</p>
<img src="expectation-augmented-breakout.png">
<p> Indeed, comparing the simple CPI Phillips curve from
	<a href="#phillips-curve">above</a> vs. the CPI and predicted
	long term inflation gap produces a much steeper,
  more stable correlation between inflation and unemployment during
  periods attributable to economic shocks and a dramatic flattening after
	2013.

<h2>3. Nominal Interest Rates and the Liquidity Trap</h2>
<img src="admiral-ackbar.gif" width="240px;" style="float:left;margin-top:20px;margin-right:20px;">
<p> New-Keynesian economics is supposed to be countercyclical; the point of
	having a bureaucrat in charge is to dampen economic cylces, making
	recessions less severe and expansions less booming/speculative;
	when a recession begins, the central bank can lower interest rates
	to encourage more loans startup more economic investment and construction.
</p>
<p> Unfortunately, this aspect of New-Keynesian economics is scientifically
	true in the sense that it has never fully been tested.
	The graph below shows that over	all six of the last six cycles, and
	especially the last four, the Federal Reserve has never succeeded in
	returning interest rates to their previous level during the good times.
</p>
<img src="interest-and-inflation-rates.png">
<p> Since the Great Recession, interest rates have been approaching the
	"zero lower bound" (ZLB), which restricts the Federal Reserve's ability
	to further lower interest rates during Covid 19 and future crises.
</p>
<p> New-Keynesian economists call this a
	<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/april-2014/the-liquidity-trap-an-alternative-explanation-for-todays-low-inflation">
	liquidity trap</a>, as defined by Keynes himself:
</p>
<p><i>There is the possibility...that, after the rate of interest has fallen
	to a certain level, liquidity-preference may become virtually absolute in
	the sense that almost everyone prefers cash to holding a debt which yields
	so low a rate of interest. In this event the monetary authority would have
	lost effective control over the rate of interest. But whilst this limiting
	case might become practically important in future, I know of no example of
	it hitherto.</i>

<h2>4. Real Interest Rates and Secular Stagnation</h2>
<p> Real interest rates, r, are defined by the Fisher equation, where i is the
	nominal interest rate for banks to borrow money from the Federal Reserve and
	&pi; is inflation.
</p>
<img src="fisher-eq.png">
<p> A second monetarist critique of <a href="#inflation">"anchored" inflation
	expectations</a>, can be made with a simple assertion: with a currency
	debased from any physical commodity, like gold, and instead based on an
	abstract commodity, natural numbers, the natural real interest rate is zero.
	Compare the graph used to make the case for inflation expectations with
	a graph of nominal interest rates:
</p>
<img src="nakamura-inflation-expectations.png" width="300px">
<img src="interest-and-inflation-rates.png" width="300px;">
<p>	As we <a href="#zlb">have seen</a>, the Federal Reserve has consistently
	failed to restore nominal interest rates to the prior level during times of
	economic expansion. If the natural (long run) real interest rate were
	zero, then the Federal Reserve's policies alone would account
	for the low inflation&mdash;ironically stable prices!
</p>
<p>
	However, new-Keynesians would counter this assertion with two arguments:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="">Taylor rule</a>: central banks tend to raise interest
		rates to counter inflation, or lower interest rates to counter recessions
		(which have low inflation), so the correlation between interest rates and
	 	inflation is caused by central bank policy, not a result.</li>
	<li>Secular Stagnation: the natural real interest rate r* is not constant and
		has been declining for at least four decades.
	</li>
</ol>
<p> I do not have a good rebuttal to the Taylor rule, except to say that
	it would be ironic if an activist economic philosophy based on dampening the
	animal spirits of the people was promulgating its own	positive feedback
	loop on inflation.
</p>
<p>	Secular Stagnation, as used by economist today, describes the
	long term fall in real interest rates and its potential causes and effects.
	The following graph is from a
	<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/On-Falling-Neutral-Real-Rates-Fiscal-Policy-and-the-Risk-of-Secular-Stagnation.pdf">
	paper</a> by Lukasz Rachel and Lawrence Summers:
</p>
<img src="summers-real-interest.png">
<p> To combat secular stagnation, Rachel and Summers argue for larger
	budget deficits and increased fiscal programs such as pay-as-you-go old
	age pensions and government health care programs to raise neutral real
	rates. However a compelling reason to combat secular "stagnation" is unclear,
  Laubach and Williams, of the LW natural real interest rate model
	<a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2015-16.pdf">
	suggest</a>:
</p>
<p><i> Since the start of the Great Recession, the estimated natural rate of
	interest fell sharply and shows no sign of recovering. These results are
	robust to alternative model specifications. If the natural rate remains low,
	future episodes of hitting the zero lower bound are likely to be frequent
	and long-lasting.</i>
</p>
<p> I.e. the motivation to avoid natural real interest rates lowering to zero
	is that the government would have to be more responsible during good times
	in order to stimulate the economy with monetary policy during recessions.
	Not very compelling.
</p>
<p>	It is the hight of irony that the new-Keynesian solution to activist
	interest rate looseness becoming	ineffective due to overuse is a more
	activist fiscal looseness by the Feds. But lets not stop there,
	it is also deeply ironic for those of gold-bug disposition (myself inclued),
	that formally leaving the gold standard finally gave the Federal Reserve
	enough room to make its own policies ineffective.
</p>
<p> Finally, there is some empirical evidence for the assertion that the
	long run natural real interest rate is zero, consider this graph from
	Paul Schmelzing in
	<a href="https://economics.rutgers.edu/downloads-hidden-menu/news-and-events/workshops/money-history-and-finance/1823-paulschmelzing/file">

<article id="dual-mandate">
<h2>Ahistorical Discretion of the Dual Mandate</h2>
<p> The Constitution says the Congress shall have power:
<ul>
	<li>To borrow money on the credit of the United States;</li>
	<li>To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,
		and fix the standard of weights and measures;
	</li>
</ul>
and that:
<ul>
	<li>No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of
		appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the
		receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from
		time to time.
	</li>
	<li>No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;
		grantletters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit;
		make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts;
		pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the
		obligation of contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> The gold standard was broken by executive order by FDR in 1933 and
	ended by Nixon in 1971 (a bipartisan affair). At each instance,
	Congress and the Surpreme Court conceded to the executive these changes.
	One can argue this breaking-change leadership was necessary given the
	circumstances or that it was an inevitable result of advances in
	economics, as Keynesians or Monetarist might, but the spirit of the
	constitution where monetary policy was subject to more constraints that
	the whims of bureaucrats was never properly ammended.
</p>
<p> The current mandate of the Federal Reserve from Congress directs:
</p>
<p>
	<em>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal
		Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and
		credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to
		increase production, so as to promote effectively the  goals of maximum
		employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.</em>
</p>
<p> Ironically, this tripartite instruction has come to be known as the
	<a href="https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate">
	dual mandate</a>, i.e. stable prices and maximum sustainable
	employment.
</p>
<p>This faux pas is likely due to the prominance of
	the Phillips curve and IS-LM model in macro economics and their
	predictions of tradeoffs between inflation and GDP
	(Phillips curve) and GDP and interest (LM Curve).
	Interest rates are seen as a policy variable to adjust these
	relationships, but virtually ignored is any correlation between
	interest rates and inequality.
