	<h1>Watching Netflix on Linux</h1>
	<p>Netflix requires that you have the Silverlight plug-in from Microsoft to stream videos.  Silverlight is free
	but there is no Linux version.  Fortunately, there is a workaround: you can run the Windows version
	using Wine.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3>Install Wine</h3>
			<p>Wine is a program that recreates the Windows environment on Linux.  What this means is that
			you can run Windows programs, such as Silverlight.  It is not super clear what Wine is an 
			acronym for.  Maybe WINdows Environment, maybe WINdows Emulator, maybe Windows Is Not an 
			Emulator, or maybe it's Wine Is Not inEbriating.  Regardless, it is easy to install with 
			the package managers.  For Red Hat, SUSE, or Fedora, open a terminal and use yum.  If you 
			are using Debian or Ubuntu, replace "yum" with "apt-get":</p>
			<p class="code_snippet">
				$ sudo yum install wine -y
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Download a Windows version of your favorite web browser</h3>
			<p>You need to go online and download an installer for a web browser.  It is
			important that you download a version that is for Windows (i.e. has a .exe file extension).  
			Sometimes this is difficult because the homepages for Chrome, IE, and Firefox
			will detect your Linux OS and automatically direct you to the
			Linux versions.  If you are having trouble, you can find Firefox for Windows at
			<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all" target="_blank">
			https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Run the .exe installer with wine</h3>
			<p>First, make a new directory for the installation.</p>
			<p class="code_snippet">
				$ cd /home/usernamehere</br>
				$ mkdir Windows_Programs
			</p>
			<p>For new Linux users:<br/>In the change directory (cd) command, you should replace "usernamehere" 
			with the username you logged in with.  You can use "$ hostname" to get your username if you 
			are unsure.</p>
			<p>Next, use the following commands to move into the Downloads directory and run the .exe installer.</p>
			<p class="code_snippet">
				$ cd /home/usernamehere/Downloads<br/>
				$ ls<br/>
				some_files&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firefox Setup 24.0.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some_more_files<br/>
				one_more_file<br/>
				$ sudo wine Firefox\ Setup\ 24.0.exe
			</p>
			<p>For new Linux users:<br/>By default, downloads from the internet are stored in the Downloads folder.
			If you chose "save as" and downloaded to a different folder, you will need to navigate to that folder
			instead of Downloads.  The list command (ls) shows you the files in the current directory.  Look 
			for the .exe file which you just downloaded.  When you type the wine command, you only need to 
			type the first several letters of this filename.  Simply hit 'tab' and Linux will automatically 
			complete the name.</p>
			<p>Once the installer has loaded, choose a custom install so you can select the destination folder.  
			Select the new folder you created earlier.  Hit next many times to finish the installation.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Run the web browser with Wine</h3>
			<p>Change directories to the installation folder and determine the name of the executable 
			program.  Then run the executable using Wine.</p>
			<p class="code_snippet">
				$ cd /home/usernamehere/Windows_Programs<br/>
				$ ls<br/>
				firefox.exe<br/>
				$ wine firefox.exe
			</p>
		</li>

	</ol>
