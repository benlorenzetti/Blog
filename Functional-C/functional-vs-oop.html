<p> During my college years, programming languages could be readily classed as
either functional or object-oriented based on features omitted:
C does not have disjoint unions (tagged unions) for function returns, Scheme
does not distiguish between memory locations on the stack and heap.
Omitting features has advantages, but as mainstream languages have added
missing features, dividing languages into functional vs OOP camps
this way has become blurry.
Time has passed, do we have a better definition of functional and
object-oriented programming? Are they inherently
contradictory as old flame wars suggest or possibly complimentary?
</p>
<p> This mirrors intuitionist logic itself, can we define functional and
object-oriented programming based on what they are rather than what they are
not? Functional languages develop the relationship between procedures,
conditionals and intuitionist logic, while object-orientation draws memory
maps and facilitates non-canonical (user-defined) memory layouts. I do not
think the following are inherent aspects:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Immutability for functional languages</li>
  <li>V-tables bound with class heirarchy for object-orientation</li>
  <li>?</li>
</ol>

<p> I have been trying to shoehorn linear types into other features
  I want for my language, in particular natural numbers and pointers with
  limited success and lots of wasted time. My goal is to finally decide if
  these features pair naturally or not.
