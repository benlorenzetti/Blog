<h1>Functional C</h1>
<p> This essay explores the functional semantics of the C programming language,
  in particular how C embodies two big ideas:
  <ol>
    <li>Objects and functions in programs are like propositions and implications
      in logic proofs,
    </li>
    <li>Objects and functions can be composed.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p> A third idea, which I call operation-oriented programming, is often
  associated with functional programming. Operations are functions of the form
  <span class="nowrap">T &times; &middot;&middot;&middot; &times; T &rarr; T</span>
  for some type T. For example:
  <div class="C">
    struct complex { float real; float imag; };
    struct complex a, b;
    struct complex mul(struct complex c1, struct complex c2);
  </div>
  The function <span class="C">mul</span> is an operation on complex numbers,
  so for operation-oriented language we might write
  <span class="C">a mul b</span> instead of
  <span class="C">mul(a, b)</span>.
  Since operations &sube; functions, its easy to see how the conflation arises
  and its not such a bad con; I wish C had more such macros.
</p>
<section id="boolean-algebra">
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p> A nice basis for Boolean algebra is one unary
  plus two binary operators, operating on the set of values
  <span class="nowrap">&Bopf; = {T, &empty;}</span> storable in a single bit
  or a subspace of a word in memory. The binary operators have the type
  signature
  <span class="nowrap">&Bopf; &times; &Bopf; &rarr; &Bopf;</span>
  so their cardinality is
  <span class="nowrap">|&Bopf;|^|&Bopf;&times;&Bopf;| = 2^(2*2) = 16</span>,
  i.e. there are 16 possible binary operators. For
  <span class="nowrap">unary &Bopf; &rarr; &Bopf;, there are 2^(2)</span>
  possible: negation, buffer, always zero, and always true.
  Five of the 16 possible operations are listed in the table below.
</p>

    <th></th>

  </tr><tr>
    <td>Negation</td>
    <td>&not;a</td>
    <td>T if a = &empty;</td>
    <td class="C">INV</td>
    <td class="C"></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>Disjuction</td>
    <td>a &or; b</td>
    <td>T if a = T or b = T (min function)</td>
    <td class="C">OR</td>
    <td class="C"></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>Conjunction</td>
    <td>a &times; b</td>
    <td>T if a = T and b = T (max function)</td>

    <td>a &rarr; b</td>
    <td>&not;a &or; b</td>
    <td class="C"></td>
    <td class="C">functions</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> Exclusive or and implication demonstrate how the other operations can be
  constructed algebraically from the basic three, given two propositions
  (a and b) that could be either true (T) or false (&empty;).
  This is classical logic, and in the sense of functional programming,
  the proposition is
  <em>that an object exists in memory and fits its type</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, any three of the 16 operations could be chosen as bases and
  more than three can be offered as intrinsic/built-in. The most common for
  type systems are {&oplus;, &times;, &rarr;}.
</p>

<h2>Connectives</h2>
<p> I claim that C already has five functional connectives built into the
  compiler: &times;, &oplus;, &rarr;, &#8612;, and ";" or structure, union,
  function, store, and statement. The connectives operate on the
  proposition that all objects follow their type once they are born.
  The compiler operates on the predicate that every statement the programmer
  makes is truth (T).
  But to explore this further we need the truth tables.
</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2em">
  <tr>
    <th>a</th>        <th>b</th>        <th>|</th>  <th>&times;</th>  <th>&oplus;</th>  <th>&rarr;</th>   <th>&#8612;</th>  <th>;</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<ol>
  <li><h3>"times"</h3>
<p> The first operator &times;, called <em>and</em> in classical logic,
  <em>times</em> in Girard's,
  or <span class="C">struct</span> in Richie's, allows us to define a larger
  object type in memory from a concatenation of smaller ones, corresponding to
  a cross product of the state spaces of the substructs. For example the
  <span class="C">struct</span> type
  <span class="C">char &times; char</span> has
  <span class="nowrap">|char|*|char| = 256*256</span> possible values.
</p>
<div class="C">
  struct shortint { char high; char low; };
</div>
<p>
  From the truth table we see that an object of type A&times;B is only true if
  both its parts a and b exist in memory and follow their respective types.
  We add the additional notion that they are adjacent in memory.
  It is unfortunate in C that structures and arguement lists cannot be conflated.
</p>
</li>
<li><h3>"xor"</h3>
<p> The second operator &oplus;, called <em>exclusive or</em>, <em>plus</em>,
  or <span class="C">union</span> has the meaning in C that this block of
  memory could be interpreted as either type A or type B, but the
  compiler has no idea which one is correct. In set space, its cardinality
  is probably <span class="nowrap">|A&oplus;B| = |A| + |B|</span>, like the
  disjoint union of sets, but we rarely actually care to calculate the
  cardinality of our types so specifying this seems unproductive. It is
  unfortunate in C that the union type cannot have any nominal intersection
  of substructures.
</p>
</li>
<li><h3>"functional imp"</h3>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2em">
  <tr>
    <th>a</th>        <th>b</th>        <th>|</th>  <th>&rarr;</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> The case for functions is more nuanced, so we reach for the truth
  table. If a function <span class="C">mul</span> has type
  <span="nowrap">mul: &Copf;&times;&Copf;&rarr;&Copf;</span>, then we must
  first determine (or indeed select <span class="C">mul</span> based on) if
  an object <span class="C">(a1, a2]</span> exists in memory and has type
  <span class="nowrap">&Copf;&times;&Copf;</span>.
  You would have already asserted this is true (T) with
  <div class="C">
    struct complex a1 = {.real = 0.6, .imag = 0.8};
    struct complex a2 = {.real = 1, .imag = 0 };
    struct complex b;

    b = mul(a1, a2);
  </div>
  i.e. by declaring, initializing, and <em>listing</em> <span class="C">c1</span>
  and <span class="C">c2</span>. The compiler will typically use a case from the
  truth table that makes the expression <span class="C">mul(a1, a2)</span> T.
  Thus, if the arguement list
  <span class="nowrap">a &isin; &Copf; &times; &Copf;</span> type checked T,
  then the standard behaviour is a proof the result 'b' exists with the proper
  type &Copf;.
</p>
<p> Otherwise, if the result object is <span class="C">void</span> (&empty;)
  then the entire expression would evaluate false, possibly signaling a logic
  error, which would be the desired compiler behaviour if we think
  <span class="C">fprintf(stdout, "Good")</span> is semantically superior to
  <span class="C">printf("Bad")</span>.
  Bjarne Stroustrup already improved C in this regard by introducing
  input output streams.
</p>
<p> This and the other lower cases
  <span class="nowrap">{&empty; &rarr; &empty;, &empty; &rarr; T}</span>
  will be considered more deeply but to preview,
  the compiler can fail, despite accepting false (&empty;) or mistyped argument
  lists, because the <em>idempotent function</em> results in the untypable,
  ambiguous, generic (T).
</p>
</li>
<li><h3>"store"</h3>
<p> The most hackily-conjucted connective <em>store</em> (&#8612;),
  called <em>assignment</em> in C, is a conjuction of two logical operators:
  proposition implication (&larr;) and object aliasing (+).
</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2em">
  <tr>
    <th>b</th>        <th>a</th>        <th>|</th>  <th>&larr;</th>   <th></th>         <th>+</th>        <th></th>   <th>&#8612;</th>  <th></th>   <th>a&oplus;b&oplus;a</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>&times;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>         <td>&times;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>       <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&times;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>&times;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> Because C allows objects to be recycled in space and time,
  connectives may be asserted multiple times down their truth table: once
  immediately as an expression is evaluated but then potentially a lower case
  later. The statement
  <span class="C">b &#8612; a;</span> for propositions
  <span class="nowrap">a, b &isin; T</span> is first an implication
  <span class="nowrap">(case T &larr; T)</span> that
  <em>if a exists and follows its type, then so does b.</em>
  However, after the store is complete the statement could be
  downgraded to a lower case
  <span class="nowrap">T &larr; &empty;</span>, i.e.
  <em>a's memory could be recycled</em>.
</p>
<p> If we had wanted to introduce store (&#8612;) without implication and
  or (b &larr; a) &times; (b + a), we could have done so using xor
  memory-wise:
  <span class="nowrap">b &#8612; a &equiv; a &oplus; b &oplus; a</span>,
  i.e. <em>if a and b don't intersect, then both a and b</em>, otherwise
  <em>if a and b would intersect, then it has to be b</em>. Another reading
  would be
  <em>a or b is equivalent with a</em> (with, in Girard's sense).
</p>
<p> However, as Girard's paper on
  <a href="http://girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/Synsem.pdf">linear logic</a> notes,
  we can introduce OR like a symmetric implication;
  i.e. even if the object on one side dissapears (becomes &empty;), then the
  other object is still valid (T).
  <div>
    a + b &equiv; (&not;a &rarr; b) &equiv; (&not;b &rarr; a)
  </div>
  In this context, C's use of a symmetric operator <span class="C">=</span> for
  "store" is very insightful, although ultimately I agree with
  C++ and Alexander Stepanov that specified, non-symmetric
  semantics are needed and it shouldn't have been the symbol that means equality.
</p>
<p> Thus the logic expression for "store" can be expressed
  <div>
    b &#8612; a &equiv; a &oplus; b &oplus; a &equiv; (b &larr; a) &times; (b &larr; &not;a)
  </div>
  which signifies the possibility of a's memory being recycled after the store
  and the <em>idempotent store</em> results in the specific type T (b &isin; T).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>"statement"</h3>
<p> The connectives so far have provided a way for the programmer to
  write propositions (variable types) and manipulate them as true or false
  values (objects), but the statement operators
  <span class="nowrap">{; , :}</span> allows the compiler to
  assist the programmer in this task by <em>building lists of true
  statements</em>.
</p>
<p> This includes listing procedure steps and concatenating procedure arguments,
  if a store operation or an argument could ever fail to be true,
  the compiler should prevent this contradiction.
</p>
<p>
  There is great value in the idea that everything is an expression
  <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming">[Haskel: Functional Programming]</a>
  <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/expressions-vs-statements/">[F# Expressions vs. Statements]</a>
  but I'm not sure the linguistic rigamarole is worth it, I'd rather still call
  them statements in some order. ...Idempotent...

<h2>Functional C</h2>
<p> The C programming language has fundamentally functional semantics,
  including connective features
  <span class="C">struct</span>, <span class="C">union</span>,
  functions, assignments, and statements, or
  <span class="nowrap">&times;, &oplus;, &rarr;, &#8612;, and ';'</span>.
  However, in using these functional features, there is friction
  from C's syntax and its depth of analysis of structures, unions, and function
  types, leaving room for improvement in newer languages.
</p>
<p> In C we can compose functions at runtime, but many functional languages go
  further by emphasizing a special functions that can <em>operate</em> on
  the abstract syntax tree to compose at compile time (macros). Many also
  emphasize that functions should be proper mathematical functions
  (no side effects).
</p>
<p> Giving special status to a subset of functions seems useful (macros), but
  restricting the set of procedures to a subset of functions seems unproductive
  (no side effects). A <span class="C">time()</span> procedure with type
  <span class="nowrap">&empty; &rarr; &Zopf; &times; &Zopf;</span>
  vacuously passes the logic test for implication, despite returning a
  different result each time called.
  Less obvious is whether it should be possible to use procedures of type
  <span class="nowrap">T &rarr; &empty;</span> with double negation.
</p>
<p> These and other controversial cases/connectives will be the topic of
  my next essay,
  <a href="./classical-c.html">
    <span class="nowrap">Classical C</span>, or, freedom implies nothing.
