<h1>Ternary C</h1>
<p> The <a href="./classical-c.html">previous essay</a> argues the functional
  connectives in C <span class="nowrap">{&rarr;, **, &#8612;}</span>
  are paired with classical logic rather than intuitionistic logic
  and how, along with other built-ins
  <span class="nowrap">{&not;, &times;, &oplus;, ;}</span>
  they help keep valid program state.
  The <a href="./index.html">next prior essay</a> had introduced these
  connectives in terms of boolean logic with the classical truth propositions,
  <ul>
    <li>T &equiv; <em>the object exists at the referenced location and follows its type</em></li>
    <li>F &equiv; <em>the object does not exist, does not fit its type, or has zero type information</em></li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p> Part of what makes C so interesting is how False was hacked together.
  As an experiment, this essay attempts to develop separate symbols to
  disambiguate the propositions above.
  I call the result the firth of fourth diagram.

<p> The C Language has two <em>false</em> symbols <span class="C">NULL</span>

  <em>the object exists at the referenced location and follows its type</em>.

<p> The <a href="./index.html">previous essay</a>
  introduced connectives
  <span class="nowrap">(&times;, &oplus;, and ;)</span>
  and two forms of implication in C,
  <span class="nowrap"><em>stores</em> (&#8612;)</span> and
  <span class="nowrap"><em>functions</em> (&rarr;)</span> but
  there is another form,
  <span class="nowrap"><em>pointers</em> (**)</span>,
  which have the semantics that a T pointer references a true
  object but <span class="C">NULL</span> pointers may or may not
  indicate a T object. For comparison a <em>reference</em> (*) can never
  have a false (&empty;) pointer and always points to a true (T) object.
</p>
<hr>
<section id="empty-pointer">
<a href="#top">top</a>
<h2>&empty; Pointers</h2>
<p>
  A good example of <span class="C">NULL</span> pointers is dynamic C-strings,
  which have a pointer to a
  location in memory containing a sequence of characters which ends at the
  first occurance of the &empty; character (all 255 other
  <span class="C">char</span> values are T).
</p>
<img class="figure" src="c-string.png" width="50%">
<p> However consider the undefined code below (using ** for pointers and * for references):
  <div class="C">
char**a = NULL;
char**b = (char**) calloc(42);

if (!strcmp(a, b))
    printf("true");
else
    printf("false");
  </div>
</p>
<p> Because the <span class="C">NULL</span> character has integer value 0,
  any length of zeros is equivalent to an empty string with no
  memory allocated, represented by the &empty; pointer.
  On the other hand, a <span class="C">wizard</span> type might not consider the
  &empty; pointer to indicate valid object of that type. Thus these two object
  types represent the
  <span class="highlight-done">
    two vacuous cases <span class="nowrap">(a = &empty;)</span> for **;
  </span>
  i.e. the ** connective does not provide enough
  information to determine if
  <span class="C">**wizard he-who-cannot-be-named = NULL;</span>
  either doesn't exist at all or if his soul lives on at 0.
  <span class="nowrap">(&empty; ** &empty; &equiv; &empty; ** T &equiv; T)</span>.

<h2>(&empty; &rarr; x) Functions</h2>
<p> Next, can useful functions be vacuously true
  <span class="nowrap">(&empty; &rarr; T &equiv; <span class="highlight">T</span>)</span>?
  Recall that operations are functions of the form
  <span class="nowrap">T &times; &middot;&middot;&middot; &times; T &rarr; T</span>
  for some specific type T, but the practical operation
  <span class="nowrap">time: &empty; &rarr; &Zopf;&times;&Zopf;&times;&Zopf;</span>
  does not always return the same value. So we have something that is
  a useful operation but not a function, despite the fact
  <span class="nowrap">operations &sube; functions</span>.
  There are several more useful examples:
  <div class="C">
    nop();
    rand();
    malloc(size_t);
    gets(NULL);
  </div>
</p>
<p> The question posed by this contradiction is actually a specific instance
  of a more general issue: <em>must all arguments and results be explicit?</em>
  For example,
  <div class="C">
    const char *arg = "a";
    char *str = (char*) malloc(1024);
    *str = 0;
    int n = 6;

    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++)
      printf(strcat(str, arg));
  </div>
</p>
<p> In this example, the composed function
  <span class="nowrap">printf &#8728; strcat()</span> is called
  n times on the same arguments but the output will print
  <span class="nowrap"><em>1 + 2 + 3 + &middot;&middot;&middot; + n = n(n + 1)/2
  aaaaaa's</span></em> instead of <em></span>n aaa's</span></em> because the variable
  <span class="C">str</span> is being modified on each iteration.
</p>
<figure>
  <img class="figure" width="50%" src="./monty-python-and-the-holy-grail.jpg">
  <caption>He who is valient and pure of function, may find the Holy Grail in
    the Castle of Aaaaaaaa.
  </caption>
</figure>
<p> The example shows that even when all arguments are explicit, a function's
  stored result can still vary if any arguments live outside the function's
  stack frame. Again, this goes against the mathematical definition of a function
  because it returns different results for same arguments. The problem is threefold,
  <ol>
    <li>not all argument and result objects are referenced on the function stack</li>
    <li>arguments living outside the stack may be modified without a visible store</li>
    <li>arguments living outside the stack may be modified by other processes</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p> First, there is little gained in securing (1) unless (2) and (3) are also
  dealt with, but there are some benefits to fixing all three and thereby
  making functions referentially transparent.
</p>
<p> Second, C has keywords <span class="C">const</span> and
  <span class="C">volatile</span> to deal with problems (2) and (3), so it
  is possible to signal that a function is referentially transparent in C.
  The <span class="C">const</span> keyword is a unfortunately verbose though.
</p>
<p> Finally, with regard to the use of the word "function", there is no
  procedure available in a classic computer that is not deterministic, although
  there are variable objects in memory and some of these may change outside the
  current scope of code; so it is not innacurate to use the word "function" or
  "variable" for these in C, given the link and stack machine model C runs on.
  C's functional semantics could be improved by introducing
  <a href="#">linear types</a> as a superset of functions, to annotate
  referential transparency and help manage the link-loaded function
  stack&mdash;a part of our machine models unlikely to be replaced.

<h2>&not; Negation</h2>
<p> So far I've defended C's permissiveness around missing function
  arguments and referential transparency
  <span class="highlight-done">(&empty; &rarr; T)</span>, including
  <span class="C">malloc()</span>, which returns a <em>pointer</em>
  (not a reference) by consulting a hidden memory oracle, but even more
  questionable is its sibling
  <span class="C">free()</span>, which returns nothing
  <span class="highlight">(T &rarr; &empty;)</span>!
  This violates the definition of a mathematical function, which cannot map
  somethings to nothing, and this is reflected in the the logic:
</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2em">
  <tr>
    <th>a</th>        <th>b</th>        <th>|</th>  <th>&#8612;</th>              <th>&rarr;</th>                     <th>**</th>                       <th>*</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>                    <td>T</td>                          <td>T</td>                        <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td class="highlight">T</td>  <td class="highlight">&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>                  <td>&empty;</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>              <td class="highlight-done">T</td>   <td class="highlight-done">T</td> <td>&empty;</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>              <td>T</td>                          <td class="highlight-done">T</td> <td>&empty;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> The purely functional form has a lot to recommend it, because it makes
  transparent the memory allocation pool being updated.
  <pre>
    malloc: Global_Heap &times; &Nopf;   -> Global_Heap &times; &Nopf;*T;
    free:   Global_heap &times; &Nopf;*T -> Global_Heap;
  </pre>
</p>
<p> But so does the functionally irreverent, <em>classical C</em> form: it is
  simpler to read and hides the <span class="C">Global_Heap</span> variable
  from the namespace/userspace.
  <pre>
    malloc: &Nopf;   -> &Nopf;*T;
    free:   &Nopf;*T -> &empty;
  </pre>
</p>
<p> Why does the classical form compile? Because logical negation
  <span class="nowrap">(&not;p &equiv; (p &rarr; &empty;))</span> is being used;
  the type declaration for <span class="C">free</span> suggests that <em>its
  argument must be false when a statement calling <span class="C">free</span>
  becomes true</em>. Unfortunately C does not actually use its '!' operator in
  this context, for example I would prefer free statements be made
  explicitely true
  <pre>
    *Obj obj &lt;-+ malloc(sizeof(obj));
    free(obj) -> &empty;;
    - OR -
    !free(obj);
  </pre>

<section id="empty-store">
<a href="#top">top</a>
<h2>&empty; Store</h2>
<p> From the prior essay on <a href="./index.html">functional C</a>, the
  compiler must make every
  <em>statement</em> made evaluate true, so assuming a <span class="nowrap">
  store (&#8612;)</span>
  operation is at the root every statement, then every store must evaluate
  true.
</p>
<p> Going one step further, this implies that the "store to"
  location must be a reference, not just a pointer i.e. the object being
  stored too must have memory allocated to it per its type (T).
  This is automatically true for automatic variables in C but it could be a
  <span class="nowrap">logic error (&empty;)</span> to store to a
  <span class="nowrap"><span class="C">NULL</span>
    reference (&empty; &equiv; (a * &empty;) &#8612; b)
  </span>,
  as the logic connectives imply.
</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2em">
  <tr>
    <th>a</th>        <th>b</th>        <th>|</th>  <th>&#8612;</th>              <th>&rarr;</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>              <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>&empty;</td>  <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>&empty;</td>              <td>T</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>&empty;</td>  <td>|</td>  <td class="highlight">T</td>  <td class="highlight">&empty;</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>T</td>        <td>T</td>        <td>|</td>  <td>T</td>                    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> However, what does <span class="nowrap">
    <span class="highlight">a &#8612; &empty; &equiv; T</span>
  </span>
  mean? The semantics of declaring an automatic variable in C is:
  <span class="nowrap"><span class="highlight">a &#8612; &empty;;</span></span>
  a trivially true statement that tells us nothing about the truth of
  <span class="nowrap">a &isin; A</span>?
</p>
<p> Unfortunately many implementations
  implicitely convert this implicit store &empty; to store 0.
  Although this ensures variables are automatically true (T), it conflates
  <span class="C">void</span> and <span class="C">NULL</span>, which
  semantically separate compile time truth from runtime truth.
  A more desirable solution would be <em>allowing proof by contradiction,
  because statements are tautologies.</em>
  <div class="C">
    int a;
    a &lt;-+ a;    // proves a &isin; int
    a &lt;-+ &not;a;   // proves a &isin; int without a runtime instruction
  </div>
</p>

<a href="#top">top</a>
<h2>Classical C</h2>
<ul>
  <li>T &equiv; <em>the object exists at the referenced location and follows its type</em></li>
  <li>&empty; &equiv; <em>the object does not exist or does not follow its type</em></li>
</ul>
<p> It is well established
  <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/lineartaste/lineartaste-revised.pdf">[Wadler</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic">Wikipedia]</a>
  in intuitionistic logic <em>to not offer not</em> (&not;) as
  <a href="./index.html#boolean-algebra">a base connective</a>,
  instead constructing negation from implication and false
  <span class="nowrap">&not;a &equiv; (a &rarr; &empty;)</span>.
  Further, a purely functional language would not admit a function of type
  <span class="nowrap">T &rarr; &empty;</span> into its type system,
  so its semantics could have no type negation&mdash;and indeed no false types.
</p>
<p> But looking again at the propositions for <span class="nowrap">{&empty;, T}</span>
  in C, an &empty; object could just mean <em>empty of type information</em>,
  which proves useful for function composition because
  <span class="C">void*</span> can be used for generic types.
  In this way C is <em>more classically functional than purely functional.</em>
</p>
<p> Also associated with negative types and results,
  C is <em>more classically logical than intuitionistically logical</em>
  because statements are tautologies. The empty function
  <span class="C">void free(void*)</span> returns to a tautology,
  <span class="C">free(a);</span> thus we can conclude
  its argument is false after free.
</p>
<p> Classical semantics provide the freedom to let
  <em>free() imply nothing</em>, aiding the composition of functions at runtime.
  However there is still some handwaving around the mathematical
  definition of functions and around
  <a href="./ternary-c.html">tautological statements and the zero middle</a>.
  Stay tuned.
