<p> A tax system to change the social relationship between capital and labor
and reclaim our federal constitution. A repeal of the 16th amendment and
replacement of income, capital gains and dividend taxes with a VAT to:

<li>Tax the productive use of capital</li>
<li>Tax the maintenance of capital</li>
<li>Reserve for states the direct taxation of capital</li>
<li>Share control of central bank issuances between proletariat and bourgeoise</li>
</ul>

<p> The goal of this tax would be fund the government and defend the currency.
The tax change from today would be mathematically regressive (though I would

But the goal of a tax system is not progressivity. As Andrew Yang's
candidacy demonstrated, progressivity flows from government spending,
not taxation.

<p> This would be a major structural change. The root of structural
inequality in modern America cannot be solved be valuing the labor of some
greater than the labor of others. Rather, the republican nature of our
government should be extended to the federal reserve to give the
proletariat and the bourgeoise a shared control the currency's issuance
and appreciation. Thus instead of class progressivity, the second goal
of federal taxation is enabling currency progressivity.
