ISP's cannot be trusted to self-regulate, as shown by multiple instances of throttling, arbitrary data caps, and other anti-consumer behavior. I must implore you NOT to roll back the protections afforded by the FCC during the previous administration, as that will lead directly to an aggressive dismantling of Net Neutrality as a living concept. ISPs must be faced with ""utilities-style"" regulation as they have shown they cannot be trusted otherwise. Thank you for listening to citizens, who I believe will be overwhelmingly against the elimination of these common-sense regulations.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am self employed and need a free and open internet in order to survive. Killing Net Neutrality would end all that and put my well being in danger. Millions of citizens across the US need an open internet in order to function properly. The removal of Net Neutrality would not only ruin this ability but severely place our country behind the rest of the world. Our leadership in terms of guiding the internet would be put into question. So please. For me, for my fellow Americans, and for the country itself, keep Net Neutrality in place and DO NOT push forward this harmful Restoring Internet Freedom.

Your recounting of history seems to completely ignore the .com bubble (and burst thereof), its impact on events leading into the Great Recession, the lack of infrastructure development & competition across the country outside of certain urban hubs that lead directly to the failure of true U.S. competitiveness in the world market, its direct injury and contribution to the continued lack of economic recovery across same parts of the U.S. in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and the simple fact that infrastructure and ISP companies have folded and merged until there's really only 3-4 big near-monopolies left, for the most part. And they have effectively throttled development on their own already, and that's before one takes into account their (essentially) non-compete agreements between each other, leaving many markets in the country with one or two choices to 'vote with their dollars' between.\n\nWhile I can appreciate being wary of over-regulation, the very rules and actions you are decrying and attempting to move against were made in response to real world events and situations. Your proposals are, at best, mired in fantasies of a market that doesn't exist. *If* you were willing to forcibly break up Time Warner, Comcast, and the others, your policies MIGHT work. Maybe. But nothing I see here, nor any other words or actions on the government's part, indicates any motivation in that direction.\n\nYour ideals of light regulation are nice, in their fashion. But under that regulatory dream, the U.S. has effectively floundered and failed, staying locally and internationally competitive only by virtue of out-market surpluses (such as education) and sheer, stubborn American spirit. And instead of rewarding that spirit, your proposed rules serve to strangle it.\n\nYou are our oversight representatives, ultimately answerable to flesh-and-blood citizens, not corporations. There are other ruleset models that address market problems much better than what you've proposed, without betraying the citizenry into the richest companies' hands. Stop bullshitting both me and yourselves, and go back to the drawing board.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, maintaining Net Neutrality will result in fewer regulations as maintaining this single position staves off the inevitable need for future regulation once ISPs begin to abuse their power and gouge customers for every penny they can due to the lack of competition in the retail broadband market.\n\nThank you for registering my opinion on the matter.

Without it, service providers can and will prioritize or lock access to sites of their choosing if they compete or are in conflict with them, destroying competition.  services which rely on the internet to conduct business will have to pay more to maintain their transactions, driving up costs for consumers, on top of permitting service providers to inflate their prices while reducing their services.  No-one wins by taking away net neutrality, as it was already shown in the short time it was unlawfully undone in the time before it was restored in 2015 that Comcast, verizon and the other providers were taking advantage of that power.  To remove net neutrality is to destroy the internet, which has become an essential service in our modern era.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quite frankly, I am astounded and amazed that anyone(or committee) could be so incredibly and mind boggling stupid makes me question the very principles of evolution, as it would seem preposterous that such belligerence could be bred into the human race over such a short period of time. Net neutrality is necessary, and I would go so far as to say that it is one of the cornerstones of a modern democracy, free speech, and the american dream. Net neutrality is a key component of a functional and informed democracy for several reasons: 1) net neutrality allows for the internet to be a relatively unbiased source of information, as it is possible to look at different sources of news to inform one's self. \nThe next point is that net neutrality is necessary to protect freedom of information, and freedom of speech. Without net neutrality laws, it is possible and even conceivable that ISP's would restrict access to certain domains, news sources, and web sites. This would be in direct violation of the freedom of information laws, as even the act of making it more difficult to access certain information, while mayhaps not breaking the law itself, would destroy and hide the purpose of the law. \nNow, certain members of the house and senate, or of this committee, may say that the internet is not the only method of spreading or accessing information, however in the 21st century, the internet and all the information that can be found on it, is quite frankly necessary. Furthermore, the american dream will be destroyed when you destroy net neutrality. without the ability to equal opportunity on the web, startups, small businesses and other small but necessary parts of a functioning economy will be put at a disadvantage.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I tend toward libertarian views, and believe in minimal government interference with American business. \n\nThis approach, however, does not work when businesses face minimal competition.  Allowing internet service providers (henceforth referred to by the common abbreviation 'ISP') to affect their customers' connectivity to select services would be acceptable only in a truly free market, where every customer has the right to choose providers.  Sadly, this is not the case in many places, and allows ISPs to unfairly bias their services based on their own needs rather than serve the customer who pays for service.  \n\nAn imperfect, albeit accurate, analogy would be a car company 'C' deciding that their cars would deliberately operate slower or less efficiently when using fuel from one fuel company 'B' , while unlocking additional performance when using fuel from a preferred company 'A'.  Some consumers may choose to accept this, and only buy fuel from the preferred company 'A'.  Others would exercise their right to choose and purchase cars from companies 'D','E', or 'F', or perhaps just not own a car.  In this case, company 'C' would respond to market pressure and change their policies to be more consumer friendly, or lose sales to competition.\n\nIn the case of many American markets, the choice is limited to company 'C' or no car at all.  In this instance, the government must weigh the rights of company 'C' vs the rights of millions of individual Americans and small businesses who have to continue operating despite what the government does.  I don't typically champion regulation in any form, but due to the limitations of the marketplace and costs of entry for new upstarts, combined with the essential nature of the service involved, I must implore you to ensure that ISPs are not allowed to interfere with a free and open internet.  \n\nConsider that for many people high speed internet access is as essential to their way of life (necessary for jobs, education, safety, as well as entertainment and leisure) as a car is to someone living in a rural area with no public transportation.  I'm fortunate enough to live in a small city that has multiple ISP options for most areas.  Many surrounding areas are lucky to have one or no option for anything other than extremely costly or limited cellular connections.  Internet service is as essential to modern life as paved roads were immediately after World War 2.  \n\nI thank you for your consideration, and please consider the interests of ALL Americans, not simply large corporations, when making major policy decisions.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the digital age, websites make money from people viewing their site, and subsequently viewing their ads. If their website is slow, viewers will leave, and that website will make less money because that website will have fewer views on their ads. This is how ISPs could rig the game if we get rid of network neutrality. And Comcast did this, we know this, this happened just before we made ISPs Title 2 Common Carriers. Comcast was throttling Netflix, and demanding Netflix pay them additional money, which is literally mob-tactics. Ignore the fact that Netflix was already paying their ISPs for a connection to the internet, and consumers were already paying their ISPs for access to the internet, so why the hell should my ISP, e.g. Comcast, be harming my Netflix stream demanding that Netflix pay them extra? Does this not seem wrong? That is like if I pay USPS to send my grandma a letter in the mail, and USPS hands it off to Fedex in Canada, and Fedex stops and holds the letter demanding that I need to pay them additional money for them to deliver the letter to my grandma. I ALREADY PAID YOU ASSHOLES. You could say that in a free market I could just choose a different postal carrier BUT WAIT! WHERE I LIVE I LITERALLY ONLY HAVE ONE OPTION FOR INTERNET! THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION, THERE IS NO COMPETITION! Internet service providers are common carriers, they carry the common packets and and bit and ones and zeros that I use to apply to jobs online, that I use to email my family, that I use to do research for school.

It is as pervasive and critical now to the functioning of all corners of academic, spiritual (yes, indeed!), social and business life as the air we breathe. \n\nThus I cannot endorse the proposed rulemaking to remove ‘no-throttle’ constraints, which as proposed now would insert into the very medium of the internet opportunity for providers to impede the flow of information in pursuit of profits.

While you speak of providing protections through industry measures the truth is, as you are well aware, that the FCC already attempted to protect these necessary freedoms through the use of alternative rule making without using the Title II classifications. This ended in a failure in the courts which required the previous FCC chairman to reclassify the internet providers. In my work I regularly utilize the internet to remote into my office on the weekends so that I can work seven days a week. I am also a heavy user of online video services such as YouTube and Netflix. Prior to the reclassification, I was effected by Verizon's throttling of Netflix which resulted in a worse consumer experience than should have been happening. \n\nWith the removal of these protections, there will be nothing stopping companies such as Verizon from creating services such as a remote software, and then heavily throttling all other competing software forcing me to switch to theirs regardless of how well it competes in other features. If ISPs, such as Verizon, wish for us to use their other services, force them to compete in the free market, with them on an even footing as their competitors.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a software engineer, I rely on a fast, reliable, and uncompromised connection to the internet. When the weather is bad, I work from home, where my residential internet connection often slows me down because of arbitrary limits set in place by my ISP. \n\nMy job also requires that I have access to a wide variety of websites which I cannot predict on a day-to-day basis.

It is within the power and purview of the FCC to maintain that - and by the actions of the current ISPs, it is also necessary that the FCC act instead of sitting idly by.  Without that strong protection, it is up to my ISP to decide who I can talk to, apply for jobs with, get information from, or interact with in the world.  The high infrastructure costs make the business of an end-user ISP a natural monopoly - as can be seen by the gradual consolidation of telecom and cable providers, whom either are becoming ISPs by necessity or being replaced by ISPs as the more general service.\n\nI can file this only because my ISP allows it.

ATT offers a maximum of 18 mbps download speed while Spectrum offers a maximum of 50 mbps download speed. Both offer 5 mbps of upload speed. Pricing for these plans is $70 and $95 respectively. Both of these plans are barely adequate for my wife and I's purposes: She works remotely doing financial forecasting, I'm a PhD student in computational materials modeling. If we could get faster internet, we would be willing to purchase it.\n\nIt is insane to me that, living in one of the largest cities in the United States, we not only have to settle for such sub-par service but now we may be at their whim as far as what services we can access. Without net neutrality, our internet provider may choose to throttle or even block websites that express certain views or send data in a certain way. Net neutrality doesn't prevent my ISP from throttling all traffic, or even limiting the amount of information I can access in a given period of time. It holds that my ISP cannot treat data from Brietbart.com any differently that data from CNN.com or Netflix.\n\nIf you have any human decency left, Mr Pai, you won't kill net neutrality. I should be the only one who decides what I access on the internet, not the government and certainly not the the company I pay to play the middleman. Instead of working to kill what Comcast, Spectrum, etc. pay you to kill, please work on holding these companies responsible for their actions and creating more competition, not less.\n\nI would go further and say that rules should exist relating to the proper provisioning of resources to customers: I don't have to pay less when Spectrum's network can only deliver data to me at a rate half of what I pay for.

In fact, without net neutrality, there would be no playing field or content choice, as was clearly demonstrated when Comcast choked off Netflix until Netflix paid Comcast. There appear to be no significant costs associated with net neutrality, as net neutrality has always been how the Internet functioned since its inception. Throttling is nearly always harmful to consumers. As network providers have stated, throttling is not about network management but about creating artificial scarcity to boost revenues. It is particularly pernicious when hidden, as is often the case with ""unlimited"" plans. Differential prioritization should be prevented as placing the competition and anyone who can't pay in the slow lane is obviously detrimental to consumers. Exceptions already exist, such as the one for telemedicine, so blocking paid prioritization does not harm important latency-sensitive applications and content.

In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network. Internet access should be classified as a utility.  Providers like Comcast hold monopolies in a number of areas and can do as they please without any realistic repercussions.  Corporations are beholden to their shareholders and are not capable to self-policing themselves in any meaningful way.  Legislation like this puts us in danger of slipping even further behind the rest of the world in free, unrestricted Internet access.

The premise that common carrier regulations harms the growth and well being of the Internet is a false conclusion and one only needs to look at the history of Internet connectivity to see the continued need for those protections.\n\nThe 1990’s saw the rise of the World Wide Web and the evolution of the Internet as we know it today.  For most consumer users, the connection to the Internet was via a dial-up modem connection over a Title II system, the telephone.  This open and fair playing field allowed the dial-up Internet provider market to thrive and flourish with a range of options from local ISPs to national giants like America OnLine (AOL).  Competition helped to keep prices down and quality up with the open access of the phone system allowing ISPs of all sized an opportunity to enter the market.\n\nWith the dial-up technology reaching it’s limit with 56kbps, a new connection  market opened up: broadband.  While broadband heralded in massive increases in speed, it also ushered in a dramatic consolidation of the provider market with only two primary options available: DSL and Cable.  With DSL tied to the local phone provider and cable being a single provider per market situation, the open market under dial-up was now a monopoly or duopoly situation with only one or two high speed options where there could of been dozens with dial-up.  And if you lived in an area where DSL or cable was not available, you were now left behind at the slow 56k speeds of dial-up as the rest of the Internet world moved up to 1Mbps and beyond.\n\nThe higher speeds helped to pave the way for new business models such as the digital distribution of content like music, movies and software.  It also saw a continued consolidation of the broadband provider market with companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T dominating the field.  As speeds increased, options for the consumer decreased.  As DSL’s speeds plateaued between 1 and 5 Mbps, telecom providers began moving towards fiber-based solutions such as AT&T’s U-Verse (Fiber to the Node) or FiOS (Fiber to the Home), but availability was limited.  For most users, cable would be the only high-speed broadband options above single digit Mbps speeds.  Wireless and satellite options would appear as alternatives, but while they could reach areas that cable did not, they were often more expensive and did not prove the speed or low latency of a wired or fiber connection.\n\nWhen the FCC made its 2015 decision to regulate ISPs under Title II, the content delivery market (Netflix, Amazon, iTunes, Hulu, etc.) was hitting a roadblock with the Internet provider market (Comcast, Verizon, etc.).  Video streaming services was increasing the demand for bandwidth, but if performance suffered with one ISP, there was often no choice in the market for an alternative and so ISPs had little incentive to improve their networks.  Wireless solutions such as 3G or LTE were priced to be hostile towards high data usage with data caps and overage fees.  A single movie on Netflix could cause you to go over your monthly data usage and incur huge overage fees.  DSL speeds struggled to keep up with the bandwidth requirements of HD video streams.  While fiber was an alternative to cable, the deployment was limited, and the majority of consumers were left with a single option, cable.  This monopoly position gave the ISPs increasing leverage against content providers where they could extort money in exchange for better performance on their networks.  With the merger of Comcast and NBC/Universal, there was also the danger of an ISP throttling competing video services to favor their own content.  The growing digital distribution market needed protection from abuse in this monopoly/duopoly situation in the high-speed Internet provider market.  This is where the 2015 Title II decision and Net Neutrality came in.  Much in the way that Title II allowed for a thriving and competitive market in the dial-up Internet days of the 1990’s, Title II in 2015 provided a fair playing field for digital content providers in that ISPs could not use their monopoly position to favor one service over another or demand fees from providers or consumers to improve performance.\n\nCompetition can help to regulate a market, but there is little choice in the ISP market and Title II is needed to protect content providers and ISP customers the same as with other single provider markets like water or electricity.  Municipalities have created their own high-speed networks, but are limited by local or federal laws from expanding outside their territories or even prevented from existing at all.  Google, a multibillion dollar company, entered the ISP market with Google Fiber, yet it has struggled to expand beyond a few select markets.  This barrier to competition is why we need regulations like Title II to stay in place to keep the incumbent ISPs honest and keep the Internet open with equal access to all.\n\n“Americans cherish a free and open Internet.”  The FCC’s Title II Order protects this.  Please do not take it away.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd like to register my opinion in support of Net Neutrality. Chairman Pai's recent decision to move toward a non-Net-Neutrality position of the FCC is a poor decision for the American people and will  in all likelihood result in higher rates, less competition amongst internet service providers, and a severe lack of innovation due to content providers having all the power.  It will also put many companies that rely on the internet at risk as they'll be much more at the mercy of their internet provider offering a truly free and unbiased network.\n\nThis is far from a Republican or Democrat issue. Maintaining Net Neutrality will result in fewer regulations as maintaining this single position staves off the inevitable need for future regulation once ISPs begin to abuse their power and gouge customers for every penny they can due to the lack of competition in the retail broadband market and the lack of rules in place to prevent such pricing practices.\n\nThank you for registering my opinion on the matter. I hope that the FCC will act in accordance with the will of the American People in regards to this matter.\n\n- Michael","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously large internet providers, the supporters of this change,  now want to control what we have access to.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the FCC has decided to side with large corporations rather than the American people, in this case as well as the FCC's zeal to give Ligado Networks (was LightSquared) a *free* spectrum conversion - worth billions to Ligado and something will damage our GPS system (but only in the US, ironically GPS will work fine in the rest of the world).","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without Net Neutrality, we will undoubtedly see rampant abuse of power by our limited ISP choices, and customers will face steep price increases for a service inferior to what they had before due to selective service and ""fast lane"" allotments. The ""Restoring Internet Freedom"" claims are ostensibly backwards and a sly attempt to trick consumers into believing that regulations which hamper their services are being lifted: Net Neutrality is not about new regulation--it's the way the internet has always been, and the way it needs to remain. \n\nWithout it, ISPs will triple charge consumers: once for connection, once through access to specific content and the speed at which it is accessible, and once again through passed down costs from service providers for large media platforms which will see their costs skyrocket while the ISP's own version of the same service will be greatly undercut, making competition impossible. It's giving the fox the keys to the hen-house, and they will obviously take advantage of the opportunity to make more money at the cost of shutting out emerging startups and charging people for what they already receive for free.\n\nWe should not need to learn the right course of action from other first world countries, but we should instead be leading the way on a free and open internet which is as essential as a utility in the modern era as water (and should be treated as such). Do not let the Canadian boarder (as they have just voted in favor of Net Neutrality) become the line which delineates freedom of speech, equality of data, and an open and competitive digital marketplace, from one which is hand-picked to pack the wallets and serve the message of whatever corporation controls one's regional internet service. This is a resoundingly poor decision economically, socially, and politically for the consumer and for the burgeoning digital market, and maintaining, protecting, and promoting Net Neutrality is of utmost importance.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It should not be controlled by the ISP’s alone. A neutral internet needs to be maintained and access to it should be overseen by an outside body that does not serve the ISP’s interests, but instead serves the interests of end-users. Net neutrality is essential to ensuring equal access to internet content and services. \n\nSince users have little to no control over who provides their internet service, Internet Service Providers should be neutral in regards to access speeds and charges for that, regardless of the destination and/or the creator of the content. Without outside control over the costs charged by ISP’s and access speeds provided, users are at the mercy of monopolistic ISPs. When ISPs can charge more for content and/or throttle speeds of content derived from entities not owned by the ISP than it charges for its own content, there is no free market.\n\nWithout net neutrality enforcement, ISPs will have no motivation to provide equal access to an essential tool. Concentration of internet services in the hands of a few providers who have proven time and again that, without regulation, they will over-charge and under-provide at nearly every opportunity, will be harmful to all of us.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I like an internet where Internet Service Providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T are not able to prioritize and block content. I like being able to access everything, rather than letting Internet Service Providers choose what content is available to me on the internet. I like an internet where ISPs are not allowed to pick winners and losers in internet commerce.\n\nWe live in a country where ISPs have a documented history of blocking content that they do not wish to service. We need strong regulations to prevent this. I myself live in an apartment whose landlord only offers one choice of internet provider. There is no competition here. If my ISP decides to prevent me from accessing content that it does not like, I have no recourse.\n\nRepealing net neutrality does not advocate freedom for the internet in any way. If anything, it allows ISPs to become gatekeepers to content on the internet. ISPs are allowed to pick winners and losers, and as they are monopoloies in most markets in the country, there is no way to punish this unmistakably anti-consumer behavior. The government must enact and enforce strong net neutrality rules and prevent monopolist ISPs from being allowed to determine which content their consumers can access. This is the real framework that the internet has always operated on and Net Neutrality rules only enforce this existing behavior. It is only in light of recent efforts of ISPs to prioritize and control content on their networks that rules need to take place to prevent the new and anti-consumer behavior of ISPs being allowed to serve as gatekeepers of content on the internet.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ideally, we should have municipalities setting up open fiber networks that would allow multiple service providers to tie into it to allow capitalism to do its work having multiple companies competing for business as the utility itself would be owned by the people, instead of having a stranglehold duopoly on the infrastructure. I do not support this proposal. I don't believe that these will actually be read, but Ajit Pai, should step down in shame for being a shill for the telecoms.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead he wants to classify them as a title I information service. Unfortunately, Ajit Pai is wrong just like he was on ending our privacy rights. ISPs are a common carrier just like the telephone companies. Their sole purpose is to carry our internet traffic from our homes, cell phones and businesses to the internet. Just like telephone companies do the same for voice calls. ISPs provide no useful information service to consumers. Ending net neutrality is going to reduce competition and substantially increase costs to the American public especially for services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. Ending net neutrality will allow Verizon and Comcast and similar companies push their own services like video streaming over companies like Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube because they can price them out of the market. This will DESTROY competition on the internet and increase the isp/telco monopoly. This is just another example of how corrupt Ajit Pai is. He basically violating a federal court ruling and lying to congress and the American people about the impact and need for this change. Federal courts have already determined that ISPs are common carriers under title II. He said in his speech that the title II common carrier determination cost jobs and investment. This is a complete lie. The teleco are spending billions in their infrastructure and net neutrality has had no material impact on the telcos or their investments or their profits! Every major cable company and telco has INCREASED their infrastructure spending including after net neutrality took affect. Ajit Pai has tendency to state things as fact without the objective neutral party data to back it up. He did the same thing when he lied about the isp privacy rights change. He made up facts and lied to congress. He is doing it again now. Ajit Pai is former employee and lawyer for Verizon and this change DIRECTLY benefits his former employer and is buddies in the telco industry. What Ajit Pai is doing is unethical and shows how utterly corrupt the FCC management has become. They are ignoring what the American people want and doing exactly what their former employers want. So much for draining the swamp of the corrupt and dishonest politicans and political appointees in Washington. DoJ should investigate the FCC management for potential conflicts of interest and lying to congress. Undoing the common carrier determination for isp/telco is wrong for America. These companies are already de facto monopolies in most states. Getting rid of net neutrality will only make a bad situation worse.\n\nDuring FCC press conferences and published statements this week, Ajit Pai said was no evidence of the need for regulating throttling, blocking, and paying for transport. Apparently Ajit lives under a rock because all the major internet companies including Netflix, YouTube and many others have complained bitterly about ISP demanding payment for transport to the consumer while Comcast and Verizon market their own video streaming services to the same consumer. This is the textbook definition of a monopoly and any competent lawyer would know that. But that would assume Ajit Pai was a competent lawyer....the only thing he is competent in is screwing the American public's privacy and internet freedom so his former employer Verizon and it his friends in the telecom  industry rake in billions of dollars in profits on the backs hard working Americans.\n\nEnding net neutrality is not about increasing internet freedom and choice - it is about enshrining Americans with bigger ISP monopolies. Ajit Pai is an incompetent and corrupt chairman of the FCC and is knowingly lying to Congress and the American public. \n\nEven NCTA's, a cable industry lobbyist, own data at https://www.ncta.com/industry-data completely contradicts Ajit Pai statements about net neutrality costing jobs, hurting innovation, and reducing investment. Since 1996 the cable industry has invested $250 BILLION in infrastructure and it has increased EVERY year and they have added thousands of new jobs for a total of 2.7 million.\n\nWow....how about those numbers... it is a shame you are more interested in listening to FreedomWorks's fake facts than the real ones.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like America's business backbone is small business, so to with the Internet's base is small, individual websites and small businesses.

Removing these rules would allow broadband providers to pick and choose which online services and businesses can succeed. Any competitors to the many conflicts of interest the broadband providers have would find themselves unable to compete.\n\nGoogle, Facebook, Amazon, Wikipedia, Netflix and thousands of other companies which make up many of the 6.7million+ jobs in the tech industry all stand with keeping net neutrality. They, and all the jobs and investment they have created, would not be able to exist if broadband providers had free reign to pick and choose which services are able to succeed and which are pushed to the side.\n\nDuring oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.”\n\nYear after year, providers have been shown to abuse the ability to control traffic for their own gains, even when they have specifically agreed not to. There is no sign that they have the desire or ability to change, and the rules must remain the same as they are today to ensure consumers are protected.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My ISP should do nothing more than deliver bytes to me as fast as possible. It’s up to me to decide where those bytes come from in the larger Internet.

I can think of new reason to repel net neutrality except to further line the deep pockets of ISPs who refuse to compete. I am a strong proponent for Net Neutrality I wrote in favor of it before it was made so and I shall support it if you make the mistake of attacking the American Consumer and businesses. I work at a ""Managed Service Provider"" and we support several clients, Manufacturers, Woman's Shelters, City Governments, and Scientific Research firms. and let me tell you there is no division within the rankings of my company ISPs are looking to make a buck and the quality of service rendered isn't even a second thought. I'm not saying some don't try, but we've had ISPs that allowed emergency rape counseling facility's to repeatedly lose service due to neglected infrastructure. They offered to charge us fees in order to make alternative arrangements while the services were down. For example when their DSL provider lost service my company investigated alternatives sadly there were NONE, so we reached out with the ISP in question and sought assistance in improving reliability. The ""best"" they would offer was a add-on service for $15 a month to allow multiple rapid call routes to be places. A Suicide hotline and Rape Counseling service funded with public/government funds was told they could pay extra to get the emergency number routed through the online interface, instead of having to call in and wait upwards of 45 minutes before being connected to a human being; which would then route you to hopefully but rarely the correct department to make those changes. In a single quarter they lost service for hours at a time 4 times and once for two entire days. It's possible someone committed suicide, it's possible someone was raped and never got counseling. That's just a moral story, when you start to calculate losses from profit earning clients, we are talking about serious losses for the American people, American Business and thus the US Government through Tax revenue.\n\nI could go on for hours about personal experiences, I could rant about how my ISP has attempted to charge me over a dozen times for ""leasing"" a modem I bought from Amazon. I could complain about how my speeds aren't even 1/4 the advertised speed unless you use the ISPs speed check tool.\n\nWhen Ajit Pai betrayed the entire american public by announcing his support in repealing laws protecting American consumers from being spied upon by ISPs I felt a righteous fury similar to that of someone who's God has been attacked. The rules Tom Wheeler put in place requiring Opt-In consent allowed for us as customers to take advantage of any offers to lesson the cost of service, etc by opting in to allowing our data to be used was the correct decision. When I choose an ISP I have 1-2 choices, those choices are Cable or inferior DSL, I live in a semi-large city and this is the national status quo. Opting in to the advertising program an ISP might offer is a lot like using Google, I have several choice available I can Google, I can Bing, I can even scan the internet myself and look for website; we even have DuckDuckGo! However a website is a destination like Mc Donalds, while the ISP is ""like a series of pipes/tubes"" as one congressman once put it. It's the means in which we travel, like roads or a car. It is clearly an entirely different thing all together to choose to go to Google's website, read the EULA and use their services vs hiring one of two ISPs and having all traffic being monitored.\n\nWhile I respect the Democratic process I will say this, I feel betrayed by the current Administration they promised to ""drain the swamp"" not inject it with ISP run off. Furthermore how on earth does a former ISP Lapdog (Tom Wheeler) end up being the bigger protector of American/business interests then a republican? WTF???? Pai is a terrorist in disguise trying to ruin what makes america great, Freedom of Expression, but once Muslim and Atheist controlled ISPs are free to throttle web services they don't like and crush innovation we will all be harmed and I will be filing my patents in Germany.  \n\nAlso please note the ending was satire, I don't actually think Islam controls ISPs but one day they could just like ultra-right wing Christians or Nazi's could, any group could exert their insane will over innocent people because you decided ISP freedom was more important then protecting the citizens and businesses that make America. Not a single News Paper, legitimate journal, or tech site has shown anything other then the willingness and need to fight this insanity and I will give my life if need be to protect the right to knowledge. Holy Wars have been fought over less, please don't instigate a war.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is pro-competitive, and this is a direct benefit to consumers.\n\n\nWhen is 'throttling' harmful to consumers?\nWhen it allows ISP to degrade the service of their competitors, creating an uneven choice between unthrottled and throttled content. For Example, Comcast could allow their own network video services to connect to consumers without throttling, while throttling Netflix. Please note: this is not a hypothetical, this has actually happened before. This kind of throttling stiffes competition and creates monopolies by ensuring only one service works at an acceptable level.\n\nDoes the no-throttling rule prevent providers from offering broadband Internet access service with differentiated prioritization that benefits consumers?\nNo, because differentiated prioritization does not benefit consumers.

I consider the internet to be as useful as other basic utilities like electricity or water.  It wouldn't make sense for electric company to tell me that my microwave oven could get lots of electricity while my electric car could only get a trickle.  In the same it doesn't make sense to empower ISPs to determine how much bandwidth any particular service should get5.  Beyond that ISPs advertise and commit to consumers to provide a certain amount of bandwidth (generally measure in megabits per second or kilobits per second) so it would be disingenuous and false of them to then not provide that amount in certain cases.\n\nBy allowing ISPs to throttle internet traffic they will be incentivized to throttle competitors and not their own services.  This will reinforce the lack of competition that already exists in the telecommunication space giving consumers less choice, removing competition and ultimately hurting consumers by allowing ISPs to raise prices and provide lower quality service.  It would be easy to see how a ISP would throttle Netflix to a point that it was unusable while leaving their own video service working perfectly, essentially removing the consumers choice.\n\nComcast, Charter, Verizon, AT&T and other ISPs do not often innovate; except perhaps by trying to find new ways to provide lower quality services at higher prices.  The real innovators are startup companies with big dreams and small budgets.  They need a level playing field (one provided by net neutrality) to have a better chance to succeed and be the next big thing.  By removing net neutrality large telcos like those mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph could squash small companies that rely on the internet by throttling those small companies connection to consumers to the point that consumers would find the service unusable.\n\nPlease do not allow corporate interests to rule the internet.

We have already seen similar problems around peering agreements, where telcos that provide both cable and internet services  have hampered competition by demanding to be paid twice (once by the consumer and once by the provider) in order to carry competitors' data, such as for services like Netflix.  This is a classic conflict of interest, where they are able to leverage their existing dominant position as an internet provider to unfairly disadvantage a competitor to the cable television side of their business.  \n\nISPs should not be able to shut out competition by requiring customers to pay extra to access some websites vs others.  \n\nSmall businesses shouldn't be subject to pay-to-play rules in order to be able to compete on a level playing field, but if we allow ISPs to selectively throttle, block or prioritize traffic, those that can't pay extra will be shunted to the slow lane and stand little chance against larger entrenched business, greatly limiting choices for the end consumer.  \n\nThe internet has been an incredible source of innovation and economic growth, especially for the United States.

It seems like a complicated compromise between a free internet and freedom from data fees for streaming videos via wireless.\n\nIt is not complicated at all.  The dual FCC rulings will allow advertisers to pay for wireless traffic while simultaneously ending ISPs obligation to host websites for free.  Thus turning the internet into TV.  That is a correct assessment of what is being proposed by the FCC.  THE INTERNET WILL BECOME TV.\n\nIt is a rather horrible end to the internet.  It is quickly coming to an end with an FCC decision on May 18th to end net neutrality and allow commercial enterprises to pay for free TV on your web browser but not much else.\n\nVerizon is anticipating the end of email by discontinuing their email service on May 18th.  The date is no coincidence.  They are ending their free email services and are preparing for a fee based email service to replace it.\n\nIt is likely we will be charged a fee if we want to send an email shortly but you will get to watch Netflix for free on your Smartphone entitling you to while away your time watching TV but being charged a hefty fee if you want to have an ISP host your website.\n\nThe internet is about to be turned into TV for free while we will face stiff charges if you are a business who wants to have a website hosted by an ISP.  The proposal will turn the internet into an exact model of commercial TV where access comes with a hefty price tag but corporate advertisers who pay for entertainment and commercial news and other corporate media outlets pay for it and provide it for free.\n\nThe internet should be a public commons where information is freely accessible.  The price ISPs charge for access to the internet is enough to support a business model as public utilities supplying access to the internet as well as hosting email services.\n\nThere is a purely driven profit motive here where ISPs will charge other email providers with access fees which will likely result in user fees from alternative email providers.  It is no coincidence that Verizon plans to end free email services on May 18th which is the date of the FCC ruling on the Restoring Internet Freedom.\n\nIt will indeed restore freedom to charge for access to the internet by ISPs who will reap profits from the ruling.  Everyone else will end up paying for it.\n\nThe FCC has been charged with regulating the telecommunication industry and to enact regulations which will ensure that massive commercial telecom's protect the right to free speech.  The Internet has provided up until now such a means for individual citizens to voice free speech and have the opportunity for their voices to be heard.\n\nThe Restoring Internet Freedom proposal will accomplish the exact opposite of that for citizens while guaranteeing freedom fro ISPs to charge for access to an internet which is already charged for by ISPs.\n\nThe Internet should continue to be a paid service where ISPs charge for a gateway to the internet but not to charge for access based on who is willing to pay extra fees for communication which is the basic feature of the internet like telephone and cellphone communication is not charged special fees for placing calls or sending emails.\n\nIn closing, the Restoring Internet Freedom proposed ruling is a euphemism for charging for access and ending internet freedom.  The title of the proposal has all the hallmarks of a deceptive rouse to disguise the real intention of the proposed ruling and is evident corruption and dishonest brokering by federal agencies which should be investigated and prosecuted as dis-serving the public interest that the FCC is charged to protect.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently we have a system in place that allows for development of all businesses at any level and is a content rich environment.  Limiting the size of business that can compete will limit the content and availability of information.\n\nAllowing the businesses that we pay to have access to the internet the ability to regulate what and how much of a site we access would end up with the same situation we have with cable TV.  A monopoly of businesses that control the content of what we view and how we view it.  \n\nOnce the ability to regulate is handed down it would be abused as it was similarly in many situations prior to the rule making.  Once the companies have the ability to throttle the internet on a large scale there would be a very low chance of turning back the situation.  \n\nThose are my comments that are brief for this situation but I have several other reasonable arguments against removing this rule.

The current Title II classification of Internet Service Providers  as Common Carriers provides  a competitive environment that benefits economic development, allowing new businesses with innovative ideas to compete on an equal footing.  \n\nRemoving the Common Carrier status from the Internet Service Providers would allow them to become gatekeepers to innovation, leveraging their position as carriers to financially disadvantage any new business.  This leverage could be used to weaken potential competitors enough to buy out or bankrupt them, or to take over a new emerging market by leveraging their position to under price the traffic of the competition.\n\nInternet access is essential for commerce, financial and personal communication, and increasingly , public expression.  It is no longer a luxury, it is a utility and it should be regulated as such.  \n\nIn this day and age it is unthinkable that the cost of a phone call would vary depending upon the identity of the person or business being called and their business relationship to the phone company.  Why is it acceptable that the modern essential business utility of the Internet vary in cost based on the website accessed?  \n\nI oppose removing Title II classification of Internet Service Providers as Common Carriers.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You may say that it is not your job to represent the public, but time and time again the public has made certain that you know that it wants net neutrality to be firmly protected by Title II regulations. \n\nThis is not optional, and anything else is blatantly anti-consumer, anti-internet, and anti-freedom. It is a shame to call the removal of these regulations, which ensure that all internet traffic is treated equally, regardless of political or technological content, a 'restoration of freedom'. Do what is right, and preserve net neutrality, protect consumers, and do your job. Any other outcome will ensure that you are viewed by history as someone who fought to hold back progress and justice in the name of greed.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no justification to repealing these rules, or reclassifying internet service providers (ISP) as a title I instead of a title II. internet service providers have time and time again, proven they do not care about the consumer, and the majority of ISP's advocating to repeal net neutrality helps demonstrate this. ISP's only care about their bank account, and are willing to sacrifice any little thing, for a few extra bucks. \n\nI urge the representatives voting on this, to consider the consumer, not the ISP. Vote for the people who voted for you. Vote for their rights to privacy, and vote for their rights to equal speeds regardless to whatever internet resource they visit. Do not vote to weaken or remove net neutrality. The internet is a place for information, and learning. If the internet is allowed to be restricted by having net neutrality be removed, weakened, or not enforced. ISP's will then only favor those places that pay them. Do not trust the ISP's, as they have proven to be untrustworthy. Give the power back to the consumer. Vote to keep and strengthen net neutrality.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allowing a few massive companies to control the Internet in an oligopoly will simply increase their profits by extracting the wealth from everyone else, at the cost of more than just money, but freedom of expression and ideas.  The only people who stand to benefit are the shareholders of those companies and those they pay off, such as with the 11 million in lobbying money spent by AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast just in the first 3 months of 2017.  They spent that money to increase profits, not to increase access.  We've already seen with Comcast throttling bit torrent and other companies offering zero rating that ISPs will violate net neutrality if given the chance.  There's a reason why organizations whose goal is the preservation for the free Internet, like the EFF, are against ending net neutrality.  The Internet is more than just another product to be profited off of, it has been a critical utility in the lives of tens or hundreds of millions, with more every day.  \n\nMr. Pai, you already know all this.  You know ending net neutrality is wrong.  You know it is un-American to restrict freedom of information and expression.  The question is, why are you doing this, and how do you want to be remembered.

The assumption that users even have a choice in a provider is unfounded.  In fact there have been cases of providers using their monopoly to prevent the construction of competing municipal ISPs.

Without an Internet whose freedom is protected via strong net neutrality regulations preventing the prioritization of certain data over others, it is inevitable that carriers will create ""Walled Gardens"" similar to the old, dead AOL model, which the market killed, and which the monopolistic nature of end user access facilitates the re-creation of. A strong, neutral Internet makes for a strong, free America; de-regulating net neutrality and ""trusting"" the providers to ""do the right thing"" will result in a weaker, less free America bound by strictures imposed to increase profitability, not to accommodate free exchange of ideas. \n\nIt is even more critical that Americans re-gain the right to control the dissemination of their data, including metadata generated and retained by carriers and third parties on the Internet. Browsing habits and internet usage can provide a deep look into a person's personal life, exposing as much or more about them as browsing through their bedroom nightstand or desk drawers might. Allowing this data to be aggregated and sold will mean the literal death of privacy on the internet, as companies compete to gather even more information about the subscriber to sell to third parties.

It is there to protect consumers who have PAID for access to whatever they want, provided its legal and NO ONE, not the ISP nor The Web Site or Service Provider may take efforts to influence or mitigate any access to any or all sites on the INTERNET, basically, we as end users pay for a pipe, nothing more.  Your predecessor understood this but apparently you are too lost in your love for ISP's to understand this.  You ask why ISP's should be treated like phone companies using old laws? ? It makes more sense than you think, how about we explain it like this, if I told you that only calls to  your immediate relatives would be clear and static free, unless of course your friends decided to pay ""extra"" to have that same service be allowed to your line.  Both you and your friends pay for telephone services, why would the phone company be allowed to choose who you get to call clearly, I call BS, they don't, and neither should the ISP's decide what sites I get to visit and who gets to  pay more money to guarantee ""better access"" to their own site.  Net Neutrality guarantees that traffic is traffic, no games, no taking our money and manipulating our choices through gaming the system, Please admit you are a shill for the ISP's\nPlease resign and put an actual human being back in the Chairman's Chair, robots are good as maids, and to vacuum our carpets, but not good to make serious and critical choices for us.

I agree that the internet has undergone a rapid shift in the last two decades as it went from being a niche service to an omnipresent aspect of modern life for consumers.  However, the NPRM fails to note that much of the innovation and services that consumers think about relate to companies offering services and websites that interact WITH the internet and basic internet infrastructure, not with respect to the actual network providers who transport data from one place to another. Put another way, each day in Silicon Valley (where I work in live), there is another group of would-be startup founders looking to be the next Facebook. No one is clamoring to be the next Comcast.\n\nSecond, I fundamentally disagree with the NPRM's approach to the classification between providers of ""telecommunications"" and ""information services.""  Providers of internet access do in fact transmit information of the user's choosing, contrary to Paragraph 29 of the NPRM.  When I tell my browser to load Twitter, a connection is made between myself (a point of my choosing) and Twitter's servers (a point which I have chosen to access). The suggestion that every internet user need understand the DNS system before such a request would qualify as a ""telecommunications"" service misses the point: the average use of a landline phone (or more realistically a smartphone) does not know how the handset translates the sound waves of their voice into an analog (or digital) signal, nor do they know how the phone company figures out the path between the caller and the person they intend to contact. They do, however, expect that the sound of their voice will (largely) be transferred as they perceive it, and vice versa with the person on the other end. With respect to the question proposed in Paragraph 29, the ""ambiguous"" words should be given their plain and commonly understood meaning: the user defines the endpoints of the communication. Telecommunications services transmit messages between parties who wish to communicate, whether that is my mother calling me on a phone, or whether that is my best friend sending me an instant message using Whatsapp.\n\nThe fact that internet service providers engage in network management (such as using firewalls to block malicious attacks, or managing the move from IPv4 to IPv6 IP addresses) (¶ 30) does not mean that ISPs provide ""information"" to consumers.  Network management is necessary to ensure that the intended communications between consumers can be reasonably transferred.  Yes, it is true that internet users expect that their ISP will be able to handle backend issues (such as IP address translation) in order to enable access to an online service, but so too do users of telecommunications equipment expect their telecommunications provider to ensure their infrastructure is robust enough to transmit requests, whether that be fixing downed telephone lines or ensuring that ""phreakers"" can't abuse the network to the detriment of other users. \n\nThird, the NPRM (and the public comments surrounding the process leading up to the NPRM) seems oblivious as to the realities of broadband deployment for most consumers and how broadband access differs from access to popular online services. Online services may be gated by age, but many permit consumers to sign up for free and generate revenue from advertising. Others charge recurring or one-time fees to access their services, but permit any consumer willing to pay the fee to sign up.  By contrast, broadband providers only service discrete, physical areas, and availability is determined by physical location rather than interest in the service. An unhappy Uber user deletes the app and moves to Lyft; an unhappy Comcast user must move homes for better broadband. The latter situation is far more similar to telecom providers than providers of information.\n\nA few months ago, I renewed the lease at my apartment and needed to renew my internet service. My building is wired so that the only broadband provider is Comcast -- they are the only way I can use the internet at speeds higher than 10 Mb/s.  When I called to renew, I knew their website would let me sign up for internet at $40/month at comparable speeds to my plan. However, their retention department refused to budge, insisting that I pay significantly more and that it was the ""best price"" they could do. And I realized at that moment, there was nothing I could do. I could have tried a DSL provider, paying similar amounts of money for slower speeds. I could try using my phone to tether, before my mobile provider realized and tried to cut me off. But ultimately, because broadband deployment in this country has resulted in most homes only having a single option for anything close to high speeds, I had no ability to watch news online, access email from friends, family, and elected representatives, or work online as required for my job without giving in to the price that was demanded of me.  Consumers have absolutely zero leverage or bargaining power when it comes to broadband providers, despite a robust competition in online services that require internet access to use.\n\nThe NPRM is titled ""Restoring Internet Freedom,"" ostensibly out of a concern the current internet is not ""free.""  If the Federal Communications Commission seeks to ensure reasonable internet access for a modern America, it ignores at its peril that few Americans are ""free"" to choose their internet provider.  In an age where internet providers are increasingly consolidating each other, this is the wrong time to leave them to their own devices.\n\nThe Federal Communication Commission's website states one of its strategic goals is ""protection public interest goals.""  The proposed ""Light-Touch"" regulatory framework does not further that purpose.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even with the implementation of Net Neutrality legislation and the determination that internet service fell under Title II classification, service providers have already begun down a slippery slope of zero-rating content, playing favorites, stifling competition, and attempting to create 'walled gardens' of tiered content; all of these activities are at direct odds with the idea of a free internet.\n\nThe notion that any regulation is _Bad_, and that a lack of regulation is, therefore, inherently _Good_ does not bear out in this situation. It is akin to stating that the first amendment is a top-down power grab in an attempt to legislate what does and does not constitute 'free speech' and that we should therefore enact a ""Restoring Speech Freedom"" bill, which would repeal the first amendment because speech would better flourish under a 'light-touch approach.' This is a hyperbolic analogy, of course, but I feel the comparison is apt (if somewhat heavy-handed).\n\nConsider cell phone providers (an increasingly important player in the ever-changing landscape of the internet) who do not count data used in the consumption of certain services (Spotify/Netflix/Pandora/etc) against data utilization limits, and the effect this seemingly-beneficial and apparently-benevolent action has. Competitors to the zero-rated services now face the inherent hurdle to reaching a customer base posed by the fact that their potential users would be disadvantaged by the use of their data. This represents a decreasingly level playing field, and this type of behavior has only just begun; since it was enacted by one provider, others have rapidly begun their adoption of similar practices. As a growing number of service providers implement and expand this type of data classification and throttling, it will only get worse. Established companies (Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc.) will be able to afford to pay for such benefits, but 'garage' tech startups will be unable to do so; in this type of environment, the very same technological behemoths who now stand to benefit would never have come to power. The very heart of technological disruptions and the core concept of technological competition, growth, and development are fundamentally reliant upon the notion that a good idea, implemented well, can compete with and disrupt an industry, because all traffic is treated equally. If ISPs had provided fast lanes for Altavista, while throttling Google, or if providers counted data used at Facebook against a user's data cap, while zero-rating MySpace, it would not have mattered who had the superior product, because the public would never have been exposed to the fledgling start-ups; this is not competition. Neither end users nor software developers should have limits imposed upon them (either directly, via throttling; or indirectly, via the advantages provided to competing data); THIS constitutes the core of internet freedom, not some pedantic discussion regarding the definition of terms or services. However, if we would prefer to be pedantic, please consider the practice of the widespread abuse of the word ""unlimited"" by service providers. Throttling or capping data beyond a certain threshold of consumption constitutes a limit, plain and simple. This blatant disregard for what is in the best interest of the consumer is possible because all providers do the same thing, precluding any notion that market forces will sway them to stop, and the high cost of entrance into the marketplace prevents any disruption by new competition. Additionally, consider the limited range of offerings available to the majority of your constituency. In almost all areas of the nation, consumers' decisions regarding internet service is heavily restricted. People living in multi-tenant properties typically have the choice to use the provider who services that complex, or move to another one (which, for many, many people, constitutes an untenable financial burden). People in rural areas (which constitute a geographical majority of the nation) often face similar situations, wherein they have the options of dial-up, excessively expensive (and still slow/unreliable) satellite, or nothing at all. Even those living in major metropolitan areas are limited to the very few options in their area, with perhaps two or three providers at most.\n\nWith diminishing choices available to consumers, providers will have increasing freedom to do whatever they please, which likely equates to whatever best suits their bottom line. This is the nature of business, and is not inherently bad, but it _does_ necessitate consumer protection, and the only even-handed method for implementing such protection is at the federal level. The tools to do this are already in place; we only need them to be enforced. This is not the smothering over-regulation of a draconian, legislation-happy, nanny state; this is one of the fundamental arguments _for the existence of a government in the first place_. If a government does not protect the rights of its citizens and provide the infrastructure of freedom, then what _does_ it do? Access to a free (as in speech) and open internet, where the only cost of admission is the metaphorical cover charge to get in the door, is rapidly becoming a necessary part of American life. The American Dream of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps, overcoming their circumstances, and building a better life (not only for themselves, but for all who come behind them) is still alive. It manifests in every child who learns the valuable tech skills (that, too often, their school cannot understand or afford) online, in every low-wage employee taking online courses so that they can move from a job into a career, and every factory worker who sees that their industry is changing, and goes online to learn what they can do to move with it. If none of those examples appeal to you, then, Mr. Pai, please consider the effect of the internet on the trajectory of a man who rose from being a name in real estate and reality television to the candidate that so many institutions said would never win, who defied those odds, and has recently placed you in your position. \n\nIf you truly care about internet freedom, as the nomenclature of your legislation would imply, and are not simply using the title as a blatantly manipulative play to knee-jerk flag-waving sentimentality, I ask that you not only cease any attempt at passing this legislation, but that you reverse course, and instead seek to enforce the regulations commonly referred to under the name of Net Neutrality.\n\nI sincerely thank you for your time in reading this, regardless of whether or not you take any of it to heart (although, of course, I hope you do).","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address the proposal's goal of allowing for consumer choice and freedom to innovate by internet service providers, I propose the following rule:\n\n1) When a customer signs up with an ISP, the ISP must prominently state their net neutrality policy, in a format to be determined by the commission.\n2) An ISP is prohibited from modifying their net neutrality policy for the duration of that customer's contiguous service, except by explicit consent of the customer.\n\nTraffic management policies of ISPs are normally invisible to consumers, and subject to change by the ISP at any time. In order for consumers to make an informed decision, visibility and stability of those traffic management policies is required. This does not impose any restrictions on ISPs nor on consumers. It just ensures consumers can make informed decisions.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulations and protections should only be removed when the benefits for society are explicitly laid out and understood.  Internet Service Providers already have a monopoly on broadband internet in many municipalities across the US.  This is already a major problem, as it gives them the ability to arbitrarily hike up prices with no possible recourse from the customer (there are no competitors to turn to).  Contrary to chairman Pai's absurd claims that the internet is not a necessity, the internet is in fact vital to any American who wants to maintain a professional life in this country.  The only way to continue to progress as a nation is to reclassify broadband internet as a utility and impose *more* regulations to restrict price hiking.  \n\nOne argument I've seen to support stripping net neutrality is that it allows ISPs to make more money which can be invested in the development of improved hardware, and ultimately faster, cheaper internet.  This is, of course, a very flimsy argument - to illustrate, imagine that you are Time Warner Cable or Comcast.  You make revenue off of internet and cable subscriptions, and have very little overhead expenses beyond the initial installment of cable networks.  You have no competitors in most cities, and customers will subscribe to your internet plan no matter what.  You are currently losing many cable customers to new and innovative entertainment platforms such as Netflix or Hulu that are not horrendously overpriced because they actually have to compete with each other everywhere.  In this case, you are not motivated to provide high-speed internet, because it simply enables customers to use these new services as an alternative to your overpriced cable TV subscription.  Why would you invest money into providing your customers with a better, faster, cheaper product?  They would simply use that faster internet connection to stream entertainment which is determined by fair market prices instead of subscribing to your monopolistic cable TV subscription.  Worse - what is to stop you from increasing the price by 600% on a whim?  Or providing abysmal customer service?  What are customers going to do?  Go to a competitor?  They don't exist.  \n\nNow, to complicate things, let's also remove all net neutrality regulations as well.  Now you have the ability to arbitrarily decide that Netflix and Hulu must pay you much more per requested bit of data.  This forces them to increase the prices for THEIR customers, and in the end, it essentially allows you to indirectly *punish* customers for attempting to bypass your unfairly priced products which face no market competition.\n\nIn this case, entertainment is only one small aspect of how innovation in business is damaged.  In other industries that are web-based, large, well-established companies can organize exclusive deals with the ISPs, making it nearly impossible for any small companies looking to enter the market to compete.  Reduction of regulations is not inherently bad, but it must be done with the intention of *increasing* competition and innovation.  This is the spirit which drives America forward, and it is the abandonment of this spirit which has saddled the American people with substandard, overpriced internet service.  Companies need to be rewarded for contributing *more* to society, not punished for making the big dogs look bad.  Why would we give incentive to anyone to provide a more expensive, slower internet and willingly remove all competitive threats?  This action by Chairman Pai cannot stand.  This is shameless corruption and the American people won't stand by and allow you to trample our basic rights.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as ISPs consolidated, most local markets became single-provider (in fact or in practice), ISPs realized the profit potential from new tech and a captive customer base, and innovations created services that directly competed with the ISPs' new owners' core businesses (VOIP for DSL providers like AT&T, Netflix and other video-on-demand services for cable companies like Comcast). ISPs now had reason to interfere with Internet traffic to their customers, the means to do so, and no regulations prohibiting this.\n\nAnd in fact they did interfere. Comcast blocked or degraded P2P traffic. AT&T forced Apple to block VOIP services including Skype from iPhones that used its service, and later tried to block Facetime. AT&T, Sprint and Verizon all blocked Google Wallet in favor of their own mobile payment platform, Isis (yep). MetroPCS tried to block all streaming services except YouTube. And many smaller ISPs started hijacking their customers' search engine inquiries to redirect them to search engines that the ISPs received financial compensation from.\n\nFollowing the eventual imposition of Title II common-carrier requirements, these innovation-killing, choice-killing impositions from the ISPs stopped, to the great benefit of everyone. Note that the second web economy boom followed Title II classification.\n\nThe Internet is an open, lightly regulated and very successful commons that is of great benefit to people and businesses all over the globe. However, ISPs are *not* the Internet, they're the gatekeepers to getting on the Internet. Please continue Title II classification and the imposition of common-carrier rules on ISPs. Doing so will keep the Internet as it is today - a free, open and fair place for ideas to compete.  Thank you!","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe the committee has already made their decision and is soliciting comments solely to fulfill a requirement.  \n\nI am unclear how allowing broadband companies to charge their customers for preferential access to their destinations, alongside charging other companies for preferential access to their customers will spur innovation or competition.  Especially as the large providers that the vast majority of  Americans use, straddle both sides as both an internet and content provider.  Allowing them to prioritize their own content while deprioritizing the competition, which seems to allow them to abuse their role of ISP to hinder competition in the content market.  At best, it allows them to extract tolls on both ends for the use of their ""roads"" that their own traffic can be exempted from.  \n\nIf there were true competition in the broadband market, this would not be an issue, but over 90% of Americans are faced with either effective monopoly or duopoly situations.  Additionally, this lack of true competition eliminates price competition between companies.  If I am unhappy with Comcast's service or prices, I can call and complain, but my other options are either ISPs that are leasing space from Comcast, and will be subject to the same issues, or CenturyLink which offers worse reliability.  If ISPs were forcibly decoupled from their content producing arms, and solely sold access to their network, this would be a fine solution.  But that's not the case.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following comments are hereby submitted.\nParagraph 27 purports to show that broadband Internet service is an information service because it provides users the ""capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications."" The argument given is that broadband Internet service allows users to do all these things. However, this is not the same as providing the capability to do these things. To see why, consider that providing users Internet services over dialup phone lines also allows users to do all these things; but the phone lines themselves are telecommunications services, not information services. Why? Because providing the user dialup Internet, by itself, does not provide them the capability to do all these things. That capability is provided by the endpoints: the users' computers, and the computers hosting the Internet services that the users connect to.\nExactly the same is true of broadband Internet services provided by ISPs: by themselves, they do not provide users the capability to do all these things. They only provide connections between computers at the endpoints that provide those capabilities. It is the services provided by the Internet hosts that users connect to that are ""information services"". The broadband Internet services that allow users to connect to those hosts are telecommunications services, and should be regulated as such.\nISPs object to analyses like the one above because they claim that they also provide the actual information services--in other words, they also provide Internet hosts that function as email servers, web servers, etc. But it is obvious that those services are separate from the broadband connection services provided by those same ISPs, because users can make use of the latter without making use of the former at all. I am such a user: I use the broadband Internet connection provided by my ISP, but I do not use any of the information services they provide; I do not use their email, their web hosting, etc. I use other Internet hosts provided by other companies for those services. The fact that ISPs offer information services as well as telecommunications services does not make their telecommunications services into information services; an ISP's choice of business model cannot change the nature of a particular service it provides. Broadband Internet connections are obviously a telecommunications service, and should be regulated as such, regardless of what other services ISPs would like to bundle with them.\nParagraph 28 asks whether ""offering Internet access is precisely what makes the service capable of 'generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information' to consumers?"" The answer to this question, as noted above, is no, because all of those capabilities are not provided by the mere fact of Internet access; they are provided by the endpoint computers that implement those capabilities. The question of how those computers are connected to each other, which is the relevant question for the purpose of determining whether broadband Internet service is a telecommunications service, is a separate question from the question of what capabilities the endpoint computers provide.\nParagraph 28 also asks whether consumers could ""access these online services using traditional telecommunications services like telephone service or point-to-point special access?"" Obviously the answer to this question will depend on what connectivity the providers of such telecommunications services choose to provide. But that is a different question from the question of what the nature of a particular service is. Again, the question of how computers are connected to each other is separate from the question of what capabilities the endpoint computers provide.\nParagraph 29 attempts to argue, in effect, that if most Internet users rely on their ISPs for any additional service beyond the bare fact of Internet connectivity--for example, DNS--then broadband Internet service must be an information service. Paragraph 29 also claims that the ISP, not the user, ""specifies the points between and among which information will be transmitted"", because, first, users only specify domain names, not IP addresses, and second, users do not make the routing decisions that determine the specific path information packets take through the network. Neither of these considerations affects the proper classification of broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service. Users might only specify domain names, but the service of translating domain names into IP addresses is provided by an endpoint--a DNS server--not by the bare provision of an Internet connection. (And even if the ISP typically provides this endpoint, that is still a separate service from the service of providing an Internet connection, and, as above, bundling the two together cannot change the nature of the latter.) Once the DNS service has provided an IP address corresponding to a domain name to the user's computer, the user's computer, not the network, specifies that IP address as the target of information packets, so once again, it is an endpoint, not the network itself, that determines where the information goes. And routing information packets, in and of itself, is not an information service, because it does not change the information being routed; it just accomplishes the information transmission specified by the user, from one endpoint to another. The intermediate routers that pass on information packets are not endpoints: they are not specified by the user as the targets of any information, and they do not provide any of the capabilities that make an endpoint a provider of an information service.\nThe analysis of Paragraph 29 also fails to take into account that, if it were valid, it would apply equally well to traditional phone service, which is admitted to be a telecommunications service. Users specify phone numbers to dial, but that does not require knowledge of the physical location of the target phone (and the user will often not have such knowledge), nor does it specify the route that will be taken by the information transmitted by the call. Also, traditional phone service includes directory service (411) and other ""add-ons"" that go beyond the basic provision of a connection. What makes those ""add-ons"" telecommunications services rather than information services is that they are for the purpose of facilitating the connection (or facilitating the refusal of connections which are not desired), rather than acting on the information exchanged between the users at the endpoints.\nParagraph 30 attempts to argue that network management activities such as firewalling and IPV4 - IPV6 translation constitute changing the information being transmitted. This analysis fails in two ways. First, refusing to transmit information (e.g., a firewall blocking content deemed to be harmful) is not the same as changing it. Refusing to provide a connection to a user is not the same as changing the information transmitted by the user. Second, the ""information"" which is changed by such activities as IPV4 - IPV6 translation is not the information sent by the user; it is network management information which is added to the information packets specified by the user, outside the user's control and indeed without the knowledge of most users (since most users are not familiar with the technical details of IP networking). These network management activities are no different from the activities routinely performed by phone networks to route calls--indeed, today the same physical infrastructure is often used to perform both functions, since the phone service backbone and the Internet backbone are in many cases the same networks. Similar remarks apply to services such as filtering by firewalls: phone networks can block calls from certain numbers, for example. Again, the key distinction which the analysis in Paragraph 30 fails to make is between ""add-on"" services that are for the purpose of facilitating connections, and services that are for the purpose of manipulating the information exchanged by the users at the endpoints. Only the latter are information services; the former are part of the telecommunications service that provides the connection.\nIn the light of all of the above considerations, the FCC should continue to regulate broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any suggestions that that the telecommunications industry is competitive, or that the behavior of Comcast, Verizon, AT&T and TWC are characteristic of a competitive market landscape, are simply not credible. \n\nI can see plainly that the current FCC leadership has made up its mind. I can also see plainly that the plan is to allow ISPs to extract maximum revenue from me, the consumer, with a minimum of actual service provided. This is not a pro-consumer move. To address the claim that this plan will encourage innovation, I have to point out that any company will innovate in something, the question is merely where that innovation provides the largest payoff. In this case, the FCC is moving to encourage innovation in anti-competitive business practices, rent-extraction, and a plethora of questionable advertising and billing policies of which the telecommunications industry has a unique and storied history. \n\nIn conclusion, this whole plan will affect me negatively and I know it.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allowing ISP's to throttle traffic from certain sites will allow them to charge both for consumer access to the internet and then charging again for the content providers. They want to basically charge twice, when what is being paid for is access to the sites that ISP's would be throttling. By throttling traffic, they allow for circumstances where a certain website will have advantages over other sites. This would fundamentally change the way that the internet works today and would stifle innovation and growth in any tech sectors that make use of the internet. By getting rid of net neutrality rules, you give complete and total control of access to websites to the ISP's themselves. This means that three or four companies would essentially be the gatekeepers of knowledge when it comes to the internet. The potential for censorship and unfair and unethical business practices are outrageous and ridding the internet of net neutrality would be the biggest step that could possibly be taken to cripple the internet and Silicon Valley. Not only is it ethically wrong to allow the ISP's to charge sites various rates, but it is economically unsound to be putting such restrictions on the tech sector. By doing so, millions of dollars will be lost, making it both an ethically and economically unsound idea.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would further request discussion on Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) as a means to foster competition in the market by removing a barrier to entry.\n\nI am against paid prioritization, otherwise known as ""fast lanes"" that benefit larger entities in the market at the expense of smaller or newer ones. This includes ""zero rated"" data. All legal data should be treated as equal, possibly with few exceptions for data related to security and medical needs, just to name a few. A large company like Hulu should not be able to pay for better interconnect speeds to customers over a newer entity in the market.\n\nAs ISPs have grown in size they have swallowed one another to form larger and larger private entities, while simultaneously avoiding competing with those who remain across many parts of the country. A light touch was beneficial early on, but this was when the Internet was largely new as a consumer level product. Today there's hardly a business or individual citizen who's doesn't rely on the Internet in some form or another. Several markets are changing, and the proposed nixing of Title II and Net Neutrality regulations reeks of little more than greed while clinging to outdated business models from those with the money and power to make it happen. Rather than actually compete and innovate, they would rather force their customers to cling to their old ways for no other reason than, ""We own the means of access.""\n\nI would implore Mr. Pai and other members of the FCC to strike down this proposal and move forward with implementing Title II regulations on ISPs, along with LLU as a means to foster actual competition in the market.

By killing net neutrality, you're basically giving ISPs the right to decide what I can see on the internet. What are we going to do if all of a sudden Comcast or Verizon decides that they want to charge Republican-leaning websites more than liberal ones? Or if, say, Burger King gives them some large amount of money to slow down McDonald's websites? The possibilities for abuse are endless, especially given the pretty fishy business practices most ISPs are known to engage in. \n\nAnd I don't at all understand how this is supposed to help the consumer. You've said that maybe they could raise money by charging companies more for better speed, and then they could pass that on to the rest of us via lower prices, but I just don't buy that argument. History pretty clearly shows that big powerful companies will do anything they can to remain big and powerful. I see no reason to think this time will be any different. \n\ntl;dr - I support net neutrality, and hope that the FCC keeps it around.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis purports to show that broadband Internet service is an information service because it provides users the ""capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications."" The argument given is that broadband Internet service allows users to do all these things. However, this is not the same as providing the capability to do these things. To see why, consider that providing users Internet services over dialup phone lines also allows users to do all these things; but the phone lines themselves are telecommunications services, not information services. Why? Because providing the user dialup Internet, by itself, does not provide them the capability to do all these things. That capability is provided by the endpoints: the users' computers, and the computers hosting the Internet services that the users connect to.\n\nExactly the same is true of broadband Internet services provided by ISPs: by themselves, they do not provide users the capability to do all these things. They only provide connections between computers at the endpoints that provide those capabilities. It is the services provided by the Internet hosts that users connect to that are ""information services"". The broadband Internet services that allow users to connect to those hosts are telecommunications services, and should be regulated as such.\n\nISPs object to analyses like the one above because they claim that they also provide the actual information services--in other words, they also provide Internet hosts that function as email servers, web servers, etc. But it is obvious that those services are separate from the broadband connection services provided by those same ISPs, because users can make use of the latter without making use of the former at all. I am such a user: I use the broadband Internet connection provided by my ISP, but I do not use any of the information services they provide; I do not use their email, their web hosting, etc. I use other Internet hosts provided by other companies for those services. The fact that ISPs offer information services as well as telecommunications services does not make their telecommunications services into information services; an ISP's choice of business model cannot change the nature of a particular service it provides. Broadband Internet connections are obviously a telecommunications service, and should be regulated as such, regardless of what other services ISPs would like to bundle with them. The FCC should continue to regulate broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
