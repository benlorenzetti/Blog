<h1>Net Neutrality Comments</h1>
<h2>May 04, 2020</h2>
<p>
	<a href="https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6">
		This research article by Mr. Jeff Kao</a>
	is a compelling analysis of all the 2017 FCC comments and the
	origin of the 99.7% statistic favoring Net Neutrality regulation.
	His strategy of using <em>"semantic space vectors"</em> and running
	<em>"some clustering algorithms on the meaning..."</em>, after first collating
	exact duplicates, is the best method to avoid missing the tree for the forests.
</p>
<p> The first major result is, <em>"after clustering comment categories and
	removing duplicates,...let's look at the top 300 comment campaigns that
	comprise an astonishing 21M+ of the 22M+ submissions"</em>, which suggests
	the FCC has far fewer comments to consider rather than votes to count.

	[from <em>More than a Million Pro-Repeal Net Neutrality Comments were Likely Faked</em>, Kao Article]
</p>
<p> The second major result, <em>"After clustering comment categories and
	removing duplicates, I found that less than 800,000 of the
	22M+ comments submitted to the FCC (3-4%) could be considered truly
	unique ... taking a 1000 comment random sample .., I was only able to find three
  comments that were clearly pro-repeal."</em> Thus the more widely cited
	99.7% pro-net Neutrality statistic.
</p>
<p> For the tree in the forest, a request for comments is supposed to be an
	accounting of the arguements, not a counting of the votes, nevertheless I
	find it disturbing to be in the 0.3%.
	There may be a little more contextual data readily available: here are
	the number of comments filed each day for the first month of the petition.
</p>
<img style="margin-left:5%" width="90%" src="ECFS-comments.png">
<p> The <em>"Restoring Internet Freedom"</em> petition was created on April 26,
	2017 and was featured on the Sunday night show
	<em>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</em> on May 7th, following which
	comment rates increased more than a hundred-fold.
</p>
<p> I hypothesize that the percentage of comments pro/opposed before May 7th are
	either more or less representative than after it became widely publisized,
	and that no fancy algorithms, just statistics would be required to analyze
	that data.
