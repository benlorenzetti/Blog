I support removing these regulations so that the internet is once again free and open. Repealing Title II will increase broadband deployment and competition, and expand consumer choice.

I believe Congress should hear from the experts on net neutrality and pass a law that places enforceable rules on broadband providers that prevents them or any other company from controlling the market. It may be the right decision to reverse the classification of the companies as a utility so they can continue forward like any other competitive company. That is probably the right thing to do (I'm no expert). I understand that, particularly as conservatives, you would want to limit the amount of government regulation in the market and in our lives. However, I don't think the Telecom companies are simply to be trusted. Congress needs to pass a law with bipartisan support instead of relying on FCC rules that are subject to changing administrations.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm wary of government regulation in general, but this is a classic example of a place where government regulation opens up competition and results in better products/services for everybody.\r\n\r\nIt surprised me when this issue first came up and I learned that ISPs aren't required to treat traffic equally like phone companies, shipping companies, and others are. It seems so logical that these things all belong in the same category, because none of them should be favoring some content (virtual or physical).\r\n\r\nFree and open source software is important to me, and charging even small amounts is often a huge barrier to these kinds of projects. Making it harder to get fast Internet connections to end users for open, decentralized projects is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe result of letting ISPs charge content providers for faster speeds is obvious: it will become a lot harder for new innovators to compete, and harder for organizations to offer useful services for free.\r\n\r\nLetting ISPs choose what end users do and see online is a terrible idea.

I feel as long as ISPs maintain monopolies or near monopolies over their distribution areas we need strong government regulation to protect the consumers and companies that do business on the web. We already have open investigations where ISPs are throttling businesses to force them into a fast lane (such as Verizon and Netflix) and so while it is an assumption who is to say the ISPs won't be more heavy handed once this actually becomes legal. Finally the only actions I've ever seen the ISPs make to improve their service was when Google was thinking about moving into my region. I do not believe there will be any increase in infrastructure unless there is a direct competitor with a sizeable amount of capital to back them up (unlike most smaller competitor who would likely be just bought out by the big ISPs).","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demand the preservation of an open internet and for the preservation of the Title II classification of Internet Service Providers. Reclassifying these entities would destroy the consumer internet freedoms so costly won by the internet at large.  Please preserve these consumer protections and prevent ISPs from charging smaller websites and startups for preferential access to the web. Creating new arbitrary and damaging markets for ISPs would destroy the open internet and the internet itself as envisioned by its creators. Please rethink your plan of action and think of how negatively it would impact internet users at large- this would be a grave error and a slap in the face to all the content creators who have helped make the internet what it is today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoseph Serafin","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A neutral internet is a free, fair, and equal ground for all to enjoy.\r\n\r\nMonopolies like the cable companies should have no right to impose their rules and regulations on the internet.

ISP's should not be allowed to restrict or slow content based on the source, destination or subject matter.  There is not enough competition among Internet Service Providers to give consumers a real choice of other providers.  Most consumers have only one or two providers available due to the ownership of the local loop.\n\nIf the FCC truly wishes to improve competition, it should require that the owners of the local circuit allow the circuit to be used by any ISP chosen by the consumer.  Monopolies are unfairly controlling access to the local circuit by buying up all the local circuits in large geographic areas.  Consumers cannot find enough ISPs in their geographic area to provide any real competition.

Lee's Restoring Internet Freedom Act. Too few companies own and control access to the internet; especially where I live. From what I've read on Mike Lee's page for Internet Freedom, this will allow Comcast to govern and police itself when it comes to internet connectivity. The Internet Freedom Act would be like if Wal-Mart had their own sovereignty within its doors alongside with a judge, jail, and electric chair; this is why we have local and state police, municipal and supreme justices. I understand that even though the FCC may be a bureaucratic extension of our government, the FCC should be well versed on communication technologies their constituents and themselves rely on. I understand the internet is an ever-changing beast that has lead us to great innovations, but we have to understand that the internet is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity. The moment when we the people are required to go online and apply for jobs, signup for healthcare, communicate with our insurance company, communicate with other people, do our jobs etc. is when the best interest of the internet became for the people. The FCC should be doing their job making sure nothing takes advantage of the people when connecting to the internet and not let major internet companies who are already in control decide what is acceptable for us without oversight.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, communication and commerce.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preserving net neutrality is imperative to the free market. Allowing telecom companies to have it their way would have massive repercussions that would affect everyone, from competitors to consumers - sans, of course, telecom companies and anti-neutrality politicians. Without the Title II rules and regulations, telecom corporations are given unchecked power and control over their customers' Internet access; there would be nothing to stop Comcast, for example, from throttling competitors by placing additional charges on their services or blocking their sites entirely in order to extort money from their customers. The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies to ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process. As such, I strongly disapprove of this proposal, and urge the FCC to reconsider its priorities in promoting corporate interests as opposed to those of its constituents.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Creating additional barriers to entry for small web-based firms will have a negative impact on the economy.  Here is an excerpt from my economics textbook: ""The existence of barriers to entry make the market less contestable and less competitive. The greater the barriers to entry which exist, the less competitive the market will be. Barriers to entry are an essential aspect of monopoly markets."" \n\nThe role of government is to level the playing field, strengthen competition and intervene when the market fails. Rolling back net neutrality is clearly not the purview of government.\n\nAs a consumer I feel strongly about being able to access all content at the same speed. Weakening net neutrality will decrease my choices and bias my decisions.\n\nThank you for reading my comment.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If I pay for access to the internet, I don't want my provider deciding who I can have access to, or deciding how fast or slow certain websites will be allowed to download - I pay for access, and my provider should not be able to monitor or limit who I access.  This is a free speech issue.\n\nNor do I want my internet provider monitoring my internet usage and selling that information without my EXPLICIT consent.  Already the government is too slow in protecting citizens from corporations selling our personal information, so we can't keep giving up our personal freedoms to corporations.\n\nBased on all of that, internet providers should be regulated like a utility, especially in this day and age where our society can't function without an internet that is open to all.  Corporations deciding what I can or can't watch is a slippery slope that Americans should not have to be concerned about - but it appears that we have to based on what the FCC is planning to do in the name of ""corporate needs"", not ""citizen needs"".","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internet Service Providers (ISP's) should not be given the ability to choose how and what to stream through their services. As a customer I pay for access to the internet period. The ISP should have no say in how I use the service I am paying for, nor should they be allowed to throttle, deny, or in any way interfere with my choices of where to go or what to do when using the internet. By removing Net Neutrality you are effectively letting ISP's control the internet and choose who will thrive and who will not. To give an analogy, allowing ISP's to""voluntarily agree"" to Net Neutrality is akin to allowing a fox to ""voluntarily agree"" not to eat the hens while guarding the hen house. ISP's have proven time and again that they do not care about customers, customer choice, and innovation. This has been demonstrated by ISP's colluding to avoid competing with each other, arbitrary data caps, providing misleading (if not outright lying)\nadvertising, charging nonsensical fee's that are only added to pad their bottom line, and let's not forget Comcast throttling Netfilx which started this whole thing . Simply put, placing and organization (ISP's) in charge of enforcing rules that they have a vested and conflicting interest is bad for consumers, bad for innovation, and bad\npolicy. There has been no evidence that Net Neutrality has harmed anyone. However, the argument that removing Net Neutrality will give people more choice will result in the exact opposite to be true as the only choices people have will be whatever the ISP will allow. Loss of Net Neutrality will be a loss of democracy and freedom of speech","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules.

This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.\r\n\r\nCourts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer fast lanes to websites for a fee, and Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do just this.\r\n\r\nBut if you let ISPs make some websites fast and others artificially slow—for a fee—you will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America—just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding, but I worry and figure that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, will ignore me and millions of other Americans who properly use and value the Internet as it is - free and accessable.\r\n\r\nI am also sending this to my members of Congress. Please publicly support Title II rules and denounce Chairman Pai's plans. \r\n\r\nDo whatever you can to dissuade him and give him pause.  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  This a law of Physics.  No human is immune from its affect.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nCarolynn Kohout","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can tell you without a doubt that eliminating net neutrality or ""Restoring internet freedom"" as you have put it, will without a doubt harm everyone outside of internet providers. Internet providers who I shouldn't need to remind you typically have a monopoly in their area of service and harm consumers and firms alike with little repercussions.\nI say these things assuming you actually care about this. Even if you fail to care about the people who you are supposed to protect, you should know that issues like this are further permeating the collective consciousness and are unlikely to be treated with the degree of passivity that they have been thus far. Even if current events may bolster your willingness to strip us of protections, It should be noted that after your service on the FCC, you will still have careers, and where others have sought to take rights away from the people when new opportunities have shown themselves, ie: the recent broadband privacy bill, retaliations seem to be increasing.. fitting.

It is argued this will\nfacilitate in the management of internet traffic. But, revoking the rights associated with net neutrality\nplaces consumers at an undue disadvantage. When considering “internet management” in the context of\ninternetworking, “internet management” is unwarranted.\nOne has to wonder, why manage a series of moves an individual may make at any time for any\nreason, who would be managing, and who would be managed? If “bright lines” are eliminated, these\nissues will not be addressed. For an untold number of people, using the internet will be a baseless\ninculcation and many will endure unwarranted difficulty. The ability, not the right, of internet service providers to imbue the experience under the premise of management will leave most consumers defenseless.\nWe will be better off if net neutrality is left alone.

Anyone familiar with current Orwellian practice of naming unpopular bill's for the opposite of that bill's intended effects can see from a mile away that this bill is intended to revoke Internet Freedom. Other comments have expertly detailed the litany abuses consumers have suffered at the hands of the monopolistic Internet Service Providers. I would like to point out that America has the worst broadband access in the developed world precisely because the ISP's function as an oligopoly. This will only make the USA less competitive.

Removing net neutrality is a threat to the constitution because it allows corporations (WHO ARE NOT PEOPLE) to choose the government and its subsequent policies by only allowing the voters to see what they want them to see.\r\n\r\nIt is profoundly unethical that Ajit Pai is doing this to help out his corporate buddies. As the leader of the FCC, he ought to be the person who protects the PEOPLE from the corporations. And yet, he is selling us out for a kickback. Oppose him. What he is doing is categorically wrong and he knows this, he just doesn't seem to care. But we need you to care. Please, protect net neutrality. \r\nEllen Weld","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I urge you to protect them.\r\n\r\n  Most Americans only have one choice for true high speed Internet access: our local cable company. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:\r\n\r\n  * Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""\r\n  * Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)\r\n  * Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")\r\n\r\n  They're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.\r\n\r\n  I'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\r\n\r\n  To my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\n  To the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.\r\n\r\n  To my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination. \r\n\r\n  I would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me. Please notify me of any opportunities to meet with you or your staff.\r\nAllison Sanbongi","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Real Net Neutrality is also the backbone of smaller, entrepreneurial businesses that rely on access to the same level of bandwidth as those who they are competing with. Without that level playing field, start-ups, small businesses, non-profits and public service organizations will be stifled and unable to compete. That's just flat out wrong and incompatible with the values and functioning of a democratic, free society.\r\n\r\nIt is bad enough that Chairman Pai, a former industry lobbyist for Big Telecom, is in any position to decide this issue.

Preserving net neutrality is imperative to the free market. Allowing telecom companies to have it their way would have massive repercussions that would affect everyone, from competitors to consumers - sans, of course, telecom companies and anti-neutrality politicians. Without the Title II rules and regulations, telecom corporations are given unchecked power and control over their customers' Internet access; there would be nothing to stop Comcast, for example, from throttling competitors by placing additional charges on their services or blocking their sites entirely in order to extort money from their customers. The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies to ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process. As such, I strongly disapprove of this proposal, and urge the FCC to reconsider its priorities in promoting corporate interests as opposed to those of its constituents.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pai's intention to remove ISPs from Title II is blatently anti-consumer and threatens to tilt the Internet toward profit mongering by Verizon, comcast and other telecom providers. There is nothing in this for the average Internet user except frustration over bandwidth they will lose, website that might be blocked, and the fees they will probably need to pay to the services they currently receive.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen in civilized nations, where the needs of consumers and providers are better balanced. Because concentration of ownership of cable and fiber providers is so high in the U.S., such an act of delegulation can only lead to cartels and the indifference to consumers they inevitably bring.\r\n\r\nI oppose scrapping the FCC Open Internet Rules (net neutrality rules) and strenuously urge you to exert your influence to protect them from being stripped away.\r\n\r\nPlease go on record as supporting Title II rules and denounce Chairman Pai's plans.

Depending on what company I end up working for, or if I decide to freelance and build apps, my livelihood could be at stake because the cable companies would want me to pay for premium bandwidth services, regardless of the actual capabilities of the hardware I am running. \r\n\r\nIt is bad enough that business must maintain their own T3 connections to have fast, reliable, load bearing connections to pass data around. To have to pay on top of that just to have access to that bandwidth is practically stealing. And what is this going to do to cloud providers who have to front the cost of several datacenters worth of machines? Will their customer's site performances suffer because say Amazon or Google, or Cloudant, or smaller providers couldn't pay to have access to the speeds they are used to having across all of their datacenters? Especially when distributed computing means software developers could have their resources spread across the world, possibly causing US hosted resources to bottleneck performance of the entire application! \r\n\r\nIt's not fair for the end user, and it is not fair for the content providers (ie people like me).  \r\nGareth Warren","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I urge you to protect them.\r\n\r\n  Most Americans only have one choice for true high speed Internet access: our local cable company. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:\r\n\r\n  * Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""\r\n  * Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)\r\n  * Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")\r\n\r\n  They're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.\r\n\r\n  I'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\r\n\r\n  To my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\n  To the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.\r\n\r\n  To my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination. \r\n\r\n  I would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me. Please notify me of any opportunities to meet with you or your staff.\r\nShawn","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Broadband providers should not be in the position of determining how we, the citizens of this country, use the internet.   This is an obvious conflict of interest and will negatively impact not only citizens' free access to information, but the ability of millions of companies that depend on the internet for the majority, if not all of their business, to be provided fair and unimpeded access to their sites.  If this is truly a free-enterprise system, no single corporate sector should be able to control the content we view or what type of devises we use.  \n\nThe FCC claims to support an open Internet.

How can we tackle and face other problems if we aren't even aware of them, or cannot communicate efficiently about them? We NEED to protect the internet in its current form. Defend Title II. \r\n\r\nLet us not fall back into the Dark Age by letting corporate greed take control over such a powerful tool. The consequences of such a loss would also be immeasurable. \r\n\r\nHow was a former lawyer from Verizon even allowed the chair of the FCC? Conflict of interest?

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ""light-touch"" of the Clinton era allowed various ISPs to commit unscrupulous acts against their customers: i.e. unnecessary or unclear data caps, throttling of internet traffic, etc. Various ISPs, Comcast being the most well-known, have been able to charge exorbitant prices because of ""agreements"" with cities and housing associations, with none of the money being spent to upgrade the infrastructure. Net Neutrality regulations had the opportunity to remove the monopolies and give the people options.\nThe only item of this NPRM I can agree with is a cost-benefit analysis. Has the internet, as a whole, suffered from Net Neutrality? Have those regulations closed down popular web sites? Or have the ISPs lost money because they cant run roughshod over their customer base anymore?\nThe only freedom to be restored with this NPRM is to those ISPs, and not to the American public!","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Net neutrality allows for an open sharing of opinions and ideas which is essential for a functioning democracy.  I personally rely on the internet for the majority of my information regarding what's happening in this country.  If net neutrality is destroyed, then large corporations will have monopoly power to effectively eliminate the dissemination of ideas and information that they don't want the public to have access to.  Democracy requires an informed electorate, and net neutrality is essential in order to have an informed electorate. My personal access to vital information will be seriously hampered if large corporations are allowed to slow down and stifle the websites that I and millions of Americans rely on to keep informed.  Do the right thing for democracy and support net neutrality.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I urge you to protect them.\r\n\r\nI lived in Japan for three years and paid about $25 per month for 2Gbps fiber optic line and had a choice between multiple competitors. I now live in Colorado and pay $80 per month for ""up to"" 100Mbps cable with the only available provider that offers anything above 3Mbps (Comcast Xfinity). I'm certainly not paying that extra $55 per month for excellent customer service.\r\n\r\nI can live with that disparity between Japan and the US and accept the fact that these publicly traded American companies need to boost profits at the expense of a veteran working stiff like myself. I've accepted things like these are so ingrained in the American economy that I can't really fight it. \r\n\r\nWhat I CAN'T accept is allowing ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, make some more accessible than others, or split the Internet into ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay and ""slow lanes"" for the rest.

I believe the repealing Net Neutrality is an effort by the Trump administration to constrict our 1st Amendment rights. Additionally, giving ISP's the ability to throttle traffic at their discretion will hurt small businesses and small business owners. It's appalling that the FCC is putting big business before its citizens.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He doesn't say so, of course, but he wants to let profitable companies become oligopolistic. He wants them to be able to block websites, charge more to be able to access the whole Internet, and gouge customers. He claims that this allows competition and innovation, but the market for Internet access is NOT competitive. Hardly anyone has a choice of Internet providers. Neither is it innovative. The claim of ""innovation"" is just a mask for ways to gouge people for access to value that other people produce. It's like letting private companies collect tolls for driving down city streets. The actual ""innovation"" ISPs could provide would be to provide unfettered access to the whole Internet, AND GET OUT OF THE WAY. \r\n\r\nBruce Fraser Donnelly ","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Internet should follow from the 1926 Act, which suggests that media technologies need to be governed by PICON: public interest, convenience, and necessity--adapted from utility law. A tiered Internet system is corporatist, and doesn't acknowledge that the Internet has become so embedded in our lives that it is as important as our electric or water utilities. People can access education, jobs ads, job applications, taxes, healthcare, AND political information via the Internet; this free-flow of information is paramount to democracy. To act as if the Internet is a content, rather than service provider, is to undermine democracy. The First Amendment does not apply to ISPs. The Internet is not JUST an economic driver; it has become core to our lives.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This proposal will see citizen's freedoms weakened. Mr Pai has stated that the Open Internet Order of 2010 were better rules, however under those rules Verizon was able to sue the FCC and won. It was stated that the FCC cannot enforce the rules due to their openness and lack of classification of the ISPs. I’m worried that the protections that are in place will be weakened if we change the way they’re enforced. I would support a new regulation style if it guarantees the same or better protections, but not if we lose any. Citizens should have a fair right to access internet without the deception and shady business tactics of the ISPs, of which most citizens have only one choice. This proposal is named ""Restoring Internet Freedom"", however the ""freedom"" restored by this proposal is only for the big corporations. This proposal will cause the citizens to actually lose internet freedom and allows the providers to control the internet in a way that will only benefit their own interests. Under this proposal, providers will have the ability establish fast lane/slow lane systems and have the ability to throttle an internet connection to a crawl unless the subscriber uses the services owned by the ISP. The Zero Rating system is a very valid example of this. This proposal will also allow data caps, tiered internet plans, blocking of sites against the interest of the ISPs. This proposal is taking away every protection of citizens to access the internet in a fair and open way, and will weaken the FCC and citizen's ability to make the providers answer for the immoral and unfair policies they will enact if granted the freedom they wish for under this proposal. I've never been a farmer but even I can tell you if you remove everything the sheep have to protect themselves, the wolves will tear them apart. Your duty is to protect the American People, not allow the wolves of the corporate world have their way with us. Therefore, I implore you to allow the protections in place to stay. Thank you for your time.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet.

The Internet is an integral part of everyday life in 2017, and the data that travels on it should be treated equally. This bill aims to undermine that neutrality, and give ISPs the power to dictate how you use that data. ISPs already have a near monopoly, and many consumers like myself have basically no choice of provider. This bill gives even more power to ISPs who will almost certainly use it to their advantage to charge consumers more and stifle what little competition remains, while failing to upgrade failing infrastructure to current standards. \n\nI'm just an average guy and even I can see this.

The telecommunications companies have effective monopolies in that in any given area your choice is maybe 3 providers at most. As it is, this monopoly allows them to charge out the nose for access and just pocket the profits. If they wanted to actually invest in infrastructure improvements to provide better service, they can under the current regulations, they just don't want to because it eats into their profit margin. Creating fast and slow lanes for the internet is a terrible idea which would only benefit a select few at the expense of everyone else. \n\nTo ensure an even playing field, Net Neutrality must be maintained.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

White","Please do not loosen regulations/rules governing corporations that provide internet service. I am a consumer who pays exorbitant prices for internet access now and this will only lead to increased costs for us. If Spectrum decides to charge Netflix to run properly across its network, the extra cost will most certainly be passed on the consumers like me. I already pay for the Spectrum network between myself and Netflix so why should Spectrum be allowed to charge Netflix as well. This is what I would call “double dipping”. \nAn argument has been made that this will encourage network improvements but if our recent past is any guide then the extra revenue will simply go into executive bonuses and benefits. \nMr. Pai has indicated that consumers can report any issues they have to their state and local authorities, however, since many service providers are interstate this would be difficult and/or impossible for most consumers.  The average consumer would not even know how to go about doing this and would just accept the situation.

I thought we were all for a representative government for the people but thats bull I suppose, considering the only entities getting rid of net neutrality will benefit is Verizon, Time Warner, and the like. It's very upsetting to me how little you all care about what we think. Uproar over limiting access to the internet? Wait a year or so, they'll get tired of it when we bring it up again. You all suck, and bringing back net neutrality won't change that, because this action of trying to shoot it down again shows you do not give one single solitary damn about anyone thats not a corporation trying to make a profit. \r\n\r\nI hate you, Barrett\r\nBarrett Ratzlaff","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's even more important for those of us who are fighting to build online businesses that will become the foundation of America's digital economy in the years to follow.\r\n\r\nToday, virtually every major website used by American citizens was built and developed here in the United States of America. However, if Internet providers are allowed to make a ""pay lane"" for certain media sites, streaming content, and other currently unknown web formats, that is likely to change.\r\n\r\nTo years ago, the company I worked for took serious considerations to refocus their expansion efforts into the European and Asian markets. In the letter from our CEO, the possible fees levied onto our video streaming division by the cable companies would make the United States a ""toxic marketplace"" for new websites and new web-based ventures.\r\n\r\nEvery day, millions of developers across this great nation are working to build the next great American innovation in gaming, entertainment, and web design. Make no mistake, the United States leads the world online- but if startups cannot afford to get started in the first place, or if existing powerhouses are able to stifle innovations through fees and litigation, we will lose our edge, and like so many other things, never recover.\r\n\r\nThe American people didn't mistakenly call for Net Neutrality protections. They demanded them, loudly and clearly. I am demanding them, loudly, and clearly. \r\n\r\n-Alex Macomber, Community Manager, Performa V.A.E.

However, you need to seriously think about what you are doing. This problem is bigger than your partisanship, wallet, or, god forbid, petty ego. I will give you the benefit of the doubt that you are not evil, but misinformed and lied to. So for once, please, for the sake of the country, take the time to understand why the vast majority of Americans support Net Neutrality, and while the only ones who seem to oppose it are the Cable Companies and lobbyists. Please re-approach this view with an open mind, and the good of the nation at heart. Your actions will have dire consequences for the world of free speech, something conservatives should be deeply invested in. We mean no malice, no harm, and no ill will; we only hope you will see reason. \r\n\r\nI thank you if you read this e-mail and made it this far.

In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The open internet allows people of color, like myself and my loved ones, to tell their own stories and organize for racial and social justice. When activists are able to turn out thousands of people in the streets at a moment’s notice, it’s because ISPs aren’t allowed to block their messages or websites.\n\nThe open internet allows people of color and other vulnerable communities to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. Without net neutrality, ISPs could block speech and prevent dissident voices from speaking freely online. Without net neutrality, people of color would lose a vital platform. \n\nThank you for reading and considering my comment.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All right, what do you think you're doing? Not so fast. You are trying to go in the wrong direction for the Internet. That is not how it goes. The Internet is a very important tool that shouldn't be messed with. I surf the Internet everyday to visit my favorite websites, check messages, and online information. Big cable companies are still trying to undermine net neutrality. Those rules that were put in last year as an important thing to Internet users. But, if you weaken or eliminate the net neutrality rules, big cable companies will cause websites to slow down, fast and slow lanes. We can't let cable companies get their ways. Are you listening to me? I hope you are. Because, the FCC needs to get the message very clearly. The future of the Internet is at stake, and we still have to fight for it. We all deserve to have an open and free Internet that we rely on everyday. The net neutrality rules are extremely important to us, and they must stay protected. I'm serious. We can't afford to lose this fight. Action is now. \r\n\r\nSo I'm also sending this to my members of Congress. Please publicly support Title II rules and denounce Chairman Pai's plans.
