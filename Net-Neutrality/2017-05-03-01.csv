So, I'm going to try to get to the point on\r\nwhy net neutrality and the monopolization of the internet has put\r\nus all in a horrendous spot that will be incredibly difficult to get\r\nout of.\r\n\r\nHowever, to be honest, I'm not sure Ajit Pai and those who support \r\nhe and the FCC honestly care about net neutrality and the everyday\r\npeople who depend on it (which are many). The rule prevents \r\nbroadband providers from offering preferential treatment to\r\ncontent online. It's supposed to protect innovators from broadband \r\ncompanies and the internet giants that now rule the network. \r\nNowadays, anytime competitors succeed, the giants usually also do \r\nwell. They get rents from app store revenue, from cloud storage \r\nbills and from app-install ads, among other things. When upstarts \r\ncome along with services that threaten the giants' businesses, \r\nthe giants can simply copy them and bundle their own versions with \r\ntheir popular products.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do is \r\nbuy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals\r\nfrom ever working well on people’s phones. If Google, Facebook or \r\nsome other giant offered a broadband company millions to block a \r\nrival’s service, that could trigger antitrust investigations and \r\nother negative consequences. \r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that Telecom companies are becoming internet companies \r\n(Verizon owning AOL and Yahoo) while internet companies are involved \r\nwith telecom companies. We all see the games that are being played\r\nand it's not going to end well if the people will be screwed yet\r\nagain. The giants seem likely to keep getting bigger and if we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we will all lose.\r\n\r\nDo right by us and find better ways to weaken these large\r\ncompanies while strengthening the people.  \r\nKenton Owen III","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be awarding Internet Service Providers (ISPs) the ability to impose artificial restrictions on traffic throughput to web services that don't pay an arbitrary fee to each individual service provider. This would hurt small businesses as they will be unable to increase their web presence proportionately to their own growth; this would hurt innovation in the Wireline Communications as ISPs would have no reason to expand their existing (and already outdated) infrastructure since they could just artificially restrict access to their network even further and make more profit by doing so; this would hurt the general public because the countless web services that millions of us rely on to merely exist would suddenly become more expensive to access which many of us would not be able to afford.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet.

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of:\n\n* deliberately throttling internet traffic\n* squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps\n* misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet\n* giving privileged treatment to companies they own\n* strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet\n* avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. \n\nSo to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.\n\nAdditionally, Title II has existed for many decades without issue to consumers. The chairman's interest in reversing net neutrality rules in spite of giant public outcry time and time again to this day truly reflects the chairman's hypocrisy as a formerly poor child from an immigrant family advocating on behalf of corporations rather than the average taxpayers' better interests. Disgusting to think that he has forgotten his roots on his way to the top and intends to see those left below him uprooted and torn.\n\nWe pay enough for our freedom as it is without the likes of you adding to our grief. Furthermore, in case you've been living under a rock, we are undoubtedly a booming internet-age society, by and by far. So stop trying to gut the modern American people to earn your own dirty cash like some incessant fly to filth from the stained pockets of corrupt, greedy ISPs. A repeal protects no one but corporations, and it can create further damage beyond our borders with even our good, concerned neighbors as well as unfathomable damages for smaller, local businesses and potential start-ups seeking to make their day in the light, which is not so unlike the American Dream your beloved parents pursued once, in case you've forgotten.\n\nTell the truth and cease your lies. If you're so invested in carelessly handing away our hard-earned money, you could at least try to appear transparent in your motivations and true goal, chairman. Right now, however, you are positively unsightly.\n\nhttps://www.savetheinternet.com/sti-home","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"5/3/2017","COMMENT","EXPRESS","=""17-108""","=HYPERLINK(""https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filing/1050376057116"",""1050376057116"" )","Chris","To the FCC—\r\n\r\nI will break this down in several sections to help you understand why this is a bad decision.\r\n\r\nLet's begin with ""Free Market"".  Now all the Telecoms who are saying having fast and slow lanes promote free market are full of BULL.  No corporation wants free market, they want an advantage that will put more dollars in their pockets.  The sole reason for LOBBYISTS!  Let's follow this to its conclusion.  Fastlanes are in place, Internet sites are charged exorbitant prices to use them.  Who gets the money for the fastlanes?  The FEW corporations that own/lease the wires delivering content.  A larger portion of the available line usage is dedicated to the fastlanes, and even though my Netflix uses a fastlane, my ""last mile"" internet will slow down due to the usage taken up by the fastlanes...  Guess what!  I'll still pay the same for my slower speed.  You tell me what's ""FREE"" about that market.  All I see is a few big corporations taking advantage of everyone else.  And don't give me that ""I won't feel the it"" crap.  The Internet speed isn't unlimited, the flow is only so fast, and if you push more through one pipe the other pipe loses pressure.  We're not stupid.\r\n\r\nSecond, ""Fastlanes will help fund network upgrades...""  Also Bull, America pays a higher price for slower Internet than most industrialized countries.  How is it we dump more money into our broadband access than most other countries and still have dead last speeds?  Shenanigans!  Only in REGULATED SERVICES do people pre-pay for improved service. (I.E. Public Utilities)  It's the other way around.  I would go to a better/faster service if it were available.  This is really what Free Market is.\r\n\r\nThird, Startup innovation...  Stifled!  Enough said.\r\n\r\nFourth, Choice!  Mainly Mine!  Currently I have two choices, Slow At&t DSL, or Speedy, crappy service, Comcast.  I use At&t because they are reliable and polite on the phone.  I would like the faster service, but what does speed matter if the connection is always dropping.  More the point I want 4, 5, or 10 choices so I can choose the best selection.  2 is crap and I live in Chicago.  Some people only have 1 (ONE) choice (not a choice)\r\n\r\nEquality!  It's on everyone’s lips.  Corporations have too much control of the lives of the masses.  This is one more nail in the democratic coffin.  Born is the new Oligarchy!  Prove me wrong!  You would allow a few big corporations the power to dictate to all US citizens what kind of Internet connection they can have.  By eliminating choice and innovation, and replace it with ""our way or the highway"" policies.  How’s that for equality.\r\n\r\nIf you want companies to innovate, stop giving them free money!  Make them work for it.  That's what inspires innovation, competition and improvement.  You can't just hand companies a free ride and think they're going to improve.  Where's the incentive?  They got a free ride, no need to actually work for the money.  Internet service must be a utility!  Stop messing around with us.  Stop pandering to corporate interest (and I hope you're not gotten bribes).  Make the Internet what it's supposed to be, an open place for all to learn, educate, innovate, and grow.\r\n\r\nLastly, I see an FCC Chairman pining for a career after his FCC stint is over.  Nothing says pay raise like pandering to future employers.  PROVE ME WRONG!!!\r\n\r\nThanks for reading\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\nChris","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do not agree with this proposal I feel that the ISP companies will abuse this ruling and work against the American public. ""In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.""Take a look at Comcast for example, they have been voted year after year after year as one of the worst ISP ever even though they have one of the largest customer base. ISP companies don't care to improve their service for the American public, they only wish to increase profits as much as they can. By releasing these ISP from tittle II they will provide even worse service for the American public.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know that ISPs have a fiduciary duty to make as much money as possible for their shareholders (as pretty much all businesses do). If the ISPs can make money by giving preferential treatment to data, they must do it if they are allowed to. If they aren't allowed to, it means spending millions of dollars lobbying to make it so that they are allowed to (which is why we're here). They can't be expected to do the ""right thing"" because their fiduciary duty requires them to make money, not to deliver content equally. A plan that doesn't ensure that all data is equal is a plan that could significantly hurt consumers and businesses in the long run. Even if we naively assume this will cause short term cost savings for the consumers, the long term effect will be creating a very large barrier to entry for startup internet companies which in turn could create worse options and quality of content for consumers. In cable television, if you don't like the content that Fox News is showing you, you can easily switch the channel to CNN. However, if Comcast isn't letting my Netflix stream without freezing every three seconds because Hulu is paying them millions, I can't switch to another ISP because there is only one ISP option where I live. Great deal for the ISP: get paid more money with almost no extra effort. We need some sort of non-discrimination rules with penalties to keep the ISPs honest. This will help ensure that the next Google or the next Netflix has a fair shot at delivering their data to consumers and won't be shut out. In addition, this will ensure that consumers have total choice in which data/information they consume. The internet is no longer a ""World Wide Web"" if you have to choose your ISP (assuming their area has more than one choice option) based on which websites are paying for high speed delivery. Please don't assume the ISPs will police themselves.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am against this action. Allowing internet providers to be the gatekeepers of the public internet will increase censorship, decrease opportunities and destroy our freedoms. Among the most cherished of our liberties is our freedom of speech. The internet providers should be regulated in the same way that our telephone lines and our printed mediums are regulated -- with the idea that our freedoms will never be infringed. These public utilities should continue to be overseen by the agency that will enforce the public interests and this includes protecting our freedom of speech and freedom of commerce. By removing the restrictions of net neutrality, internet providers will have free reign to censor competitors through price controls, to censor its own customers through exclusions of content and to censor the very idea of our freedom of speech through their own actions. Internet providers have already put these ideas into practice through actions that are similar in nature to these. They have lobbied governments to restrict community-based internet, they have required Netflix and other content providers to pay higher prices for internet access, they have redirected domain lookup results to their own websites, they have implemented the idea of ""bandwidth caps"" and they have stated that they intend to do more than this. The internet is a required utility for any 21st century business. The very notion that a new startup -- such as Sears -- could operate solely by mail-order would be laughable today. In order for America to proceed into modern times and to compete successfully against the global economy, we must have a fair and open internet free from any constraints. This necessarily requires oversight of the internet providers and the prompt enforcement of our liberties -- the greatest of all is our freedom of speech.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bratt","PLEASE leave the existing classification of ISP's as utilities IN PLACE and continue to enforce rules that guarantee net neutrality.\n\nThe contention that net neutrality rules are unnecessary because large internet providers may not eventually start dividing the Internet into service lanes is absurd.  Net neutrality rules have been in flux for the last decade, but once ISP's know that Net Neutrality is specifically NOT being enforced by any regulatory agency, there is NO WAY they will not start finding ways to charge either content providers or consumers for faster access to specific content.  IT WILL DEFINITELY HAPPEN, and it will definitely make it harder for ALL smaller content providers (and start-up ISP's) to compete.  No sane person who doesn't work for a major ISP or content provider would say otherwise.\n\nIn addition, the Internet is also now most certainly a ""Utility"" type of service.  It may be easier to switch ISP's than gas or electric companies because of infrastructure constraints, but that doesn't mean that the service provided is any less of a necessity to every American household in the modern age. Internet service is certainly no different than telephone service in this respect.  It is therefor perfectly appropriate to regulate ISP's as utilities!\n\nAgain,,,   PLEASE leave the existing classification of ISP's as utilities IN PLACE and continue to enforce rules that guarantee net neutrality.\n\nThank You...

We need to understand this.\r\n\r\n•\tWe need to move on from Wi-Fi and explore Light-fidelity.

Competition is good.)\r\n\r\n•\tNO TELECOM LOBBYISTS/PEOPLE/ETC IN GOVERNMENT & FCC \r\n\r\nThese implementations should be able to help America’s digital economy and help stabilize the American economy in general.

That is unacceptable. The internet's power lies in its ability to act as a free, equal conduit of information and ideas. Deregulation -- explicitly allowing ISPs to decide what content gets served at what speeds, and to whom -- will undoubtedly boost the profits of those major corporations and reduce competition for those major players that can afford to play by those rules, like Google, Facebook, and Netflix. It will do so at the cost of lost innovation, a reduced exchange of ideas, and limited openness and vibrancy.\n\nNet neutrality is not a ""regulation,"" in the same way that many other rules are. Rather, net neutrality ensures that no individual or corporation shall be able to regulate the internet.

Allowing certain companies to speed up or slow down connections to certain sites/data provides a significant advantage to larger corporations who have the ability to pay increased rent for broadband access or can acquire additional companies/content.  Small business would have no incentive to innovate and attempt to enter the market in this environment because they cannot afford to pay additional money for better speed and can be refused that benefit if the ISP owns a similar service.  Ultimately, these smaller companies are put at a competitive disadvantage.  This will lead to the continued growth of large corporations and the formation of monopolies that control all of the content and speed at which it is accessed.\n\nAs internet access becomes critical to everyday life, including commerce and access to important educational materials needed to help further careers, it is critical that there is equal access for all digital content.

One of the prime benefits of the Internet as it stands is that, by relying on the court of public opinion (Yelp comes to mind, but also the raw search numbers that boost certain unique search phrases to the top of search engines such as Google), small businesses have an opportunity to gain market share with almost no advertising overhead. I do not trust that large companies with massive marketing apparatus will stand by while allowing potential competitors to even chip away at market share, and thus profit. Governments are accountable to people in ways that corporations are not; therefore, we should not be so naive as to trust corporations to disregard their essential reasons for existing: to increase the bottom line.\n\nParagraph 82 asks for input on whether throttling should be regulated. In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network.\n\nOn top of the economic considerations, there is another reason that I do not agree with the proposed changes. What makes this country great is not only the promise of prosperity for those willing to work towards it. More central to the vision of this great experiment are the ideals of democracy. The world is constantly changing, and because of current net neutrality provisions, we are inundated by the circumstance and ramifications of a more diverse and rich account of our shared existence than ever before. By creating a two-tier system, in which corporations with political interests (all corporations have these, whether they be actively lobbied for, like coal-mining, or passively felt, like people driving as independent contractors for ride-sharing services) have the ability to decree content more or less worthy of access, we would be undercutting the very democratic values that promote the virtues of equitability, community, and the shared nature of our fate as a society.\n\nFor these reasons, I urge the FCC and its constituents to block the proposed changes to the law, and all future addenda or alterations to said law that limit the equitable and open access to data, regardless of its content, that we currently enjoy. This is a matter of money and human rights, and there are a precious few other topics that compel me to participate in the political process of our country in such a direct way. Thank you for your time.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Net neutrality is not questioned in Europe. Its currently very silly for wireless companies to be charging per-gigabyte. Same for other companies as well. If you watch movies and TV online, this severely limits you where it shouldn't. It doesn't cost these companies any extra to allow steady access to their servers. The internet is a necessity for everyone, not an option. You cannot get a job without internet access because many companies have applications online only. Its behind the success of many small companies. To change these rules and limit the access to more than what we have now, it would hamper if not destroy these small businesses, limit people's ability to get jobs, and hamper life as we know it. Many people in rural America have very limited access to any utilities as it is meanwhile you can sit in the middle of the woods in Estonia and have internet access. Something is to be said for that when a small, poor country has it free to all, where as ours looks for more ways to get more money out of people who are over charged for everything as it is now.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an attempt to make the pending rule change appear to be something of value to the general public but it is not. The rule change is of value only to corporations and persons/organizations with large funding resources that want to have their messages more easily accessible  than what is available to the general public. This is not Freedom. This is just another element of paid advertising. This is making the general user of the internet a second-class position. IT IS THE JOB OF THE FCC TO REGULATE THE COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT ON BEHALF OF AND AS AN AGENT OF THE PUBLIC, NOT SPECIFIC BUSINESS OR POLITICAL INTERESTS. There is no way to hide the intent, the purpose, the motivation, and the financial backing for promoting the proposed ruling: some people and their organizations want to have a favored edge at getting to customers, profits and influence -- while people in the general public will be less favored with using the internet as a tool of education, entertainment, research, and social interaction.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large internet service providers also have content services. They are in both the business of supplying network access between internet based businesses and their customers and competing with those same internet based businesses. Streaming content is a perfect example of this conflict of interest. The ISP owns the network that must be used for a customer to gain access to a streaming content provider. If that ISP offers a content package of their own that competes with the streaming content provider (which many do) they could degrade or cut off the connection to their competition, or charge access fees to use their network that is not worth the streaming content provider's investment simply to chase a competitor out of the market. This tactic of winning by physically cutting customers off from companies they want to do business with would lead to stagnation and higher prices due to lack of competition and no incentive for the surviving content providers to do better.\n\nIt isn't enough to just trust that large corporations that own the physical networks will not use this tactic to eliminate competition based on promises. There needs to be strong rules in place that guarantee they can not unfairly eliminate competition by simply denying them access to their networks. We don't allow electric companies to cut off or overcharge certain entities based on arbitrary rules they come up with on their own, why would we want to allow ISPs to make up their own rules on who can and can not gain access to the internet?\n\nAllowing a few to block the many from even having a chance of competing is not a free market. Net Neutrality guarantees that all content providers on the internet, regardless of whether they own the physical network, have a chance to compete. I am opposed to 17-108, or any other legislation that would hand control of the internet over to a few large corporations.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most ISPs work in effectively a monopoly with very few customers having any choice in the ISP they can choose, and we can see this lack of choice play out in the horrible customer service ratings for nearly every single ISP company.\n\nI can not see how removing the only effective check on ISPs delivering content is going to in any way work out for the consumer. It is only going to lead to further consolidation on the internet and stifle further innovation. \n\nI can hardly see a world where rolling back Title II protections for internet service could be construed as a good thing for consumers, businesses or the country as a whole.

Net neutrality ensures that all sites on the internet are treated equally, ISPs are regulated fairly, and no site, app, or service can be blocked nor required to pay for preferential treatment. Elimination of net neutrality will not benefit consumers. ISPs ability to arbitrarily throttle  internet bandwidth will not benefit consumers. The idea that eliminating net neutrality will generate all kinds of innovation that will benefit consumers is ludicrous, because in most areas there is no meaningful competition.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ruling, which effectively classified the Internet as a public utility based on a 75-year-old law, has diminished broadband investment, stifled innovation, and left American consumers potentially on the hook for a new broadband tax.\r\n\r\nThese regulations ended a decades-long bipartisan consensus that the Internet should be regulated through a light touch framework that worked better than anyone could have imagined and made the Internet an innovative, continually expanding technology that has increased productivity in many areas, expanded the universe of information sources available to average people, and enhanced communication channels. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons I urge you to fully repeal the Obama/Wheeler Internet regulations as soon as possible.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without net neutrality and regulations stating that ""internet access"" means the whole internet, there's nothing stopping an ISP limiting the accessibility to even this resource. censorship by another name, really. Also, any arguments made that the regulations are unnecessary are already suspect. If they weren't necessary, nobody would even bat an eye at their existence. We need to keep rules in place that keep businesses honest.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The creativity and innovation that I have seen from my peers is unprecedented in the history of civilization.  It has been tremendously exciting to be part of turning an idea into a product and a thriving business.\r\n\r\nAn open internet with a level playing field has given us companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, and thousands of others both large and small.  These companies all started out small, and grew into the powerhouses that they are today.\r\n\r\nNet neutrality is what allowed these small companies to grow and thrive, and it is what will power the next generation of Internet companies, and the one after that.  Without a level playing field new companies will be at a competitive disadvantage, and our thriving tech industry will be dramatically weakened. \r\n\r\nPlease protect network neutrality and a free and open internet for all.\r\n\r\n-Patti Beadles\r\nOakland California\r\n\r\n\r\nPatti Beadles","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs.

You know, because he's a douchetard. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.  The Obi-Wan High Ground, if you will...  \r\n\r\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a crud-sucking former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former kiddie-diddling employer, not the American people.

Appoint an FCC Chair who isn't a literal buttplug and will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal- because screw those guys and the horses they rode in on.\r\n\r\nTo my representative (again, to my chagrin): please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination.

In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of ""unlimited"" internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs.

Removing net neutrality would make the internet unusable by businesses who do not have the money to pay off their internet service providers for reasonable speeds. Furthermore, the restriction of the internet would allow internet service providers to censor content which they do not agree with, which both discourages free market forces and restricts free speech. As such, a repeal of net neutrality is not only unethical, it is also unconstitutional. I write this message to request you respect the values of free speech and a free market by protecting net neutrality. Thank you.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, I have the following comments to make:\n\nParagraph 73 concerns the elimination of the Internet conduct standard introduced in Title II. I am strongly opposed to this idea. The vast majority of people are only given one option for ISPs; only in a select few areas to people have a choice between multiple ISPs to use. To not have a set of standards that all ISPs follow would allow ISPs to offer sub-par service without any opportunity for consumers to switch. These companies act as a monopoly in almost all locations, and must be regulated as such.\n\nParagraph 82 asks for input about the need for a no-throttling rule. In the past, ISPs have essentially held companies hostage by throttling traffic from their websites until they paid the ISP additional money. The most famous example of this is Comcast throttling Netflix. If a no-throttling rule is not in place, what is to stop them from doing so again? This would prevent all but the largest companies, immediately crippling any hope of innovation across many industries, as many small business exist solely over the internet. This is especially true as more and more broadband companies have started branching into other businesses besides simple broadband providers, such as video. What is to stop an ISP from throttling or even blocking traffic to content generation sites that compete with their own business?\n\nParagraph 94 concerns the potential difference between mobile and fixed broadband. The line between mobile and fixed broadband has become increasingly blurred over the years, with a greater and greater market share of internet traffic happening over mobile broadband. To not enforce the same regulations on one as the other would cripple millions of consumers who rely on consistent internet across all devices.\n\nIn short, broadband providers have the capacity and shown the willingness to act without the interest of the consumer at heart, and consumers rarely have the ability to voice their displeasure due to the near monopolistic nature of ISPs. The Title II regulations are necessary to give fair access of all internet data to all consumers and promotes competition among business in all sectors. To eliminate Title II would be a detriment to every single person and business in this country except the broadband providers themselves.\n\nThank you","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ISPs don't own the internet any more than the government owns the internet. Yet, in this analogy, the ISPs want governmental control over the internet, determining the speeds of access, in a similar vein as the Chinese and North Korean governments, blatantly banning and censoring websites. \n\nThe ISPs provide a service, in the same way that the government provides a service of representation, and rights protection, to its citizens.  Government officials are compensated by tax payers, and are obligated then to listen to the people - the ISPs are no different, with the obvious exception that they are not elected (perhaps that needs to change, being that they continue to attack the free and unfettered internet). Imagine if government set up a system where hearing and approving legislation was levied out as a privilege to those that could pay for a quicker hearing. (Perhaps we don't have to imagine it!) Imagine if the court system heard cases on the basis of a theme park fastpass! This is the analogy! The ISPs want to “fastpass” the internet like it is a theme park ride. This is not what the internet is in any purposeful understanding. \n\nThe internet, in this digital age, is equivalent to the town square. Twitter has literally stated this capacity. So if this is then the case to be defended, it should be understood that any “throttling”, or speeding up, of a website's place within the town square; within the marketplace of ideas, is, an abridgement of free speech! And, more sinisterly, the ISPs could throttle websites into virtual nonexistence, giving them a perfect tool for spinning narrative into “knowable truth”, or better understood, they can determine what is seen and what is unseen. This is no different than censorship. Imagine if some online news sources didn't (or couldn't) pay for the fastpass, but others did? Narrative, and truth, would be determined by money. (Another hole in which pay to play, and money in politics will peak out it's reeking, ugly head!) \n\nThe ISPs can charge whatever they want for access to the internet, and I will fight back on ethical grounds, but to charge a price on the other side as well, effectively determining what I will see, I will fight on moral and constitutional grounds, for there, they are abridging my rights. If this were the electric company, it would be like me paying my electric bill, but finding, upon turning the lights on, that the electric company has determined that only some of the lights in my house will be powered enough for me to be able see in the dark! - because the search for truth is a dark path, intent upon enlightenment, but the ISPs would see that my “enlightenment”, is determined by money. The ISPs own the infrastructure; they own their own hardware, but they do not own the internet, and as such, I will not see them sell greater speeds to those that can afford it. I will not have my enlightenment determined. \n\nBut if these words fall on deaf ears, or find themselves within the teeth of a shredder, and the internet finds herself in the clutches of businessmen, I will nonetheless survive without her. And for those of us who find our words squelched and ignored, I would still hope that the world did not need to hear those words, and was in fact better off without our noise. But if the many unanswered questions of time do find their fulfillment in the voices silenced by money and greed, and tyrannical power, the taste of vindication in these mouths will be a sweet, yet overly decadent fruit. This is my voice; my ideals, hardened by my resolve, though perfectly ready to admit their failure. That's what makes them ideals.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having equal access to the internet has allowed my business to grow and compete with companies many time the size of mine.  On the internet everyone is a big company.  This has allowed the very best products and services to rise to the surface on their own merit.  One example is a little startup some years back called YouTube.  Google was trying to accomplish a similar service at the same time.  YouTube prevailed because the consumer liked it better.  By removing net neutrality and allowing high cost ""fast lanes"" you remove the ability for a smaller, potentially more innovative, company to compete if they are not able to afford the higher Fast Lane pricing.  As a businessman I am offended that this proposed bill is titled ""restoring internet freedom"".

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was done to protect the open state of the internet. It was done at the behest of MILLIONS of Americans. The internet exists in this free and open condition because we created it that way.\n\nIn response to paragraph 76 of the NPRM - Determining the Need for the Bright Line Rules and the Transparency Rule - one of the main motivations for the current regulations was the potential for ISPs to exert their own preferential regulations based on what they perceive to be profitable. This has not changed. Rather than equating it to other utilities, though, I would compare it to pollution. Those corporations that would have made a great deal of profit by simply dumping waste into our water supply or pumping tons of pollutants into the air instead have been compelled by the government to responsibly dispose of or clean these byproducts. In the same way, the government is preventing damage to the air and water, it must continue to prevent damage to the open internet. Blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization are hindrances to those individuals and smaller organizations that would not enjoy access to the quality of internet that everyone deserves. \n\nAs for a return to market principles, why is the profit of giant corporations more important than the wishes of the people? Corporations are increasingly putting profits ahead of people - it is the job of the government to mitigate the disaster that a free market would create. In addition, when a small number of companies offer internet access (my home is served only by Comcast and AT&T), where are my choices? Is AT&T going to offer me a non-throttled internet for an additional fee? Will Comcast allow me to choose from a menu of websites I want unblocked? Why should THEY have the choice? Furthermore, millions of consumers contacted the FCC under the previous administration to demand the regulations that you are now intending to repeal. What about your response to market principles? \n\nThe perception of an overwhelming majority of Americans, from any political leaning you can imagine, is that the government is not responsive to our needs and demands. Maintaining the current Title II regulation of the internet is what we demand. Stop fighting the American people, and start doing the job of representing our interests.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large ISP's interest in obstructing the data-equality on the internet, through the creation of artificially segregated traffic lanes, strangles any and all businesses reliant on mass consumer interaction on the internet. Artificially holding data hostage, detaining it, until either customer or business pay for its speedy delivery is counter intuitive to the founding principles of the internet, and of international business. It is irresponsible to bestow this level of power over the most important communication medium onto self-serving, profit-interested corporations that have in the past shown little to no interest in their consumers, and have repeatedly been found to engage in unfair market practices. Classifying ISPs as class II carriers strips them of the ability to interfere with content that is not theirs, and returns the internet to its intended use: to be a neutral, non-discriminating network of communication between individuals. Thank you for your hard work and attention.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network.\n\nI’m worried that the protections that are in place will be weakened if we change the way they’re enforced.

However, the ""light-touch"" regulatory framework that is currently proposed will have the opposite effect. \n\nWhen internet service providers can charge different prices for access to different pieces of information, that is not ""free and open."" The internet is a utility and should be regulated as such. \n\nIf my local gas & electric company was not regulated, what do you think would happen? They would charge prices to maximize their profits. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when they're the only option for gas & electricity, that hurts consumers (all consumers, not just the poorest, although they are undoubtedly hurt the most). \n\nApply that logic to ISPs. If ISPs are ""lightly regulated"" they will charge whatever they can to maximize their profits. Since many Americans are limited in their choice of ISPs, that means they will end up paying more than necessary for internet access. Again, that will erode the ""free and open internet"" that Americans cherish, since only consumers with means will be able to afford the essential utility that the internet is. \n\nLook what deregulation brought to the airline industry. At first it was great, consumers had many choices of which airlines to fly. But the competition caused consolidation, and now we don't have as many choices and we're being forced to live with an inferior product (getting assaulted on a plane isn't my idea of flying the friendly skies). \n\nDeregulation can be a good thing for consumers, but it can also be a very bad thing, especially with regard to essential utilities. Corporations will always seek to maximize profits, and in an unregulated environment, that will always end up harming consumers.\n\nPlease do not get rid of net neutrality. The consumers will end up losing.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I strongly disagree with current Chairman Pai's belief that the Internet does not need regulation.  Laying down and enforcing rules that prevent the segmentation into different tiers will help ensure that current environment, which has lead to one of the most significant technological advancements in human history, continues without interruption.  Chairman Pai's claim that ""Nothing about the internet was broken in 2015"" is disingenuous and ignores the previous 20 years of debate over what role the government has in regulating the Internet.  Large ISPs have been lobbying against regulation and have only behaved neutrally because the long-term picture was unclear and they didn't want to tip their hand.  Internet regulation will not stifle innovation, rather it creates a level playing field for all participants.

Data caps, throttling, and ever-degrading customer service are this industry's only trademarks. Reversing the current rules will inevitably lead to higher costs to individuals and stifle innovation among startup companies. This administration seems hell-bent on helping only those companies and people that are already firmly established and are able to line the pockets of the decision-makers. How could a startup compete with Google or Facebook, when those companies, who were born in an age of internet equality, can just pay ISPs more to ensure their searches come up first, or respond faster to user input, regardless of whose product is better? \n\nOnly a corporate shill, or an administration terrified by the light of truth and freedom of information, would argue that this is a good idea.

In the past 10 yrs., broadband monopolies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic,squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers (particularly senior citizens) about the meaning of ""unlimited"" internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong arming cities (like mine) to prevent them from giving their residents high speed internet,(which could create JOBS) and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses and all Americans deserve an open internet so we restate our position:WE ARE AGAINST THE CHAIRMAN'S PLAN TO REVERSE THE NET NEUTRALITY RULES. IT DESTROYS A VITAL ENGINE FOR INNOVATION, GROWTH AND COMMUNICATION. It turns away from govt.of the people, for the people, by the people in favor of government ""of the people, by the corporations,for the wealthy.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This isn't about large technology companies like Netflix having to pay more, as they can afford it. This is about smaller companies and startups that want to compete directly with larger companies and offer better services to consumers not being able to do so due to the overhead this will introduce. These companies can only grow and find their footing when their costs are low, this gives them the financial runway to innovate and sustain their business long enough to potentially find their niche in the market.\n\nTake for example Facebook. It too many years for Facebook to become profitable. And it took a while for Facebook to land credible investors. They needed to built social momentum and acquire a threshold of users prior to that point. Before outside investment they didn't have the funds available to pay what is being proposed. A multi-billion dollar business in the United States may have fizzled out if this rule was in place back then. The next multi-billion dollar US business is likely to fizzle out with this rule in place.\n\nPlease don't ruin the internet for sake of your lobbyists.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of this proposal is twofold: to reduce regulation on ISPs with the goal of incentivizing broadband investment and to move their regulation to the jurisdiction of the FTC where they will be governed under the same rules as websites / content providers. I believe this proposal is NOT in the public interest and ignores several basic facts about the telecommunications market. First this proposal seeks to correct an issue that does not exist. Numerous studies have shown that broadband investment has not decreased due to new regulations. It has continued at a steady pace despite the changing regulatory environment, and there is no evidence that this proposal will do anything to affect broadband investment going forward. This proposal is based only on the general (and discredited) belief that any regulation harms investment and innovation, when multiple studies have shown that most regulation merely shifts the manner in which innovation and investment occurs. Demand (not regulation) is the primary driver of business investment, and so long as consumers continue to increase their demand for broadband services ISPs will continue to invest generously. Secondly this proposal seeks to ""harmonize"" the regulation of ISPs and content providers by putting them both under the jurisdiction of the FTC and subjecting them to the same rules. This goal of fairness ignores the fundamental differences between ISPs and content providers. Content providers are numerous, competitive, and have limited control over consumers overall use of telecommunications networks. Because of the low cost of hosting content, new content providers routinely pop up giving consumers many options when it comes to the websites they can consume content from. From a technical perspective these content providers are limited in the amount of data they can collect about consumers and in the control they have over consumers' overall use of telecommunications networks. IPSs are fundamentally different. In most markets ISPs are not competitive and consumers have little ability to leave ISPs who engage in harmful practices. ISPs also have the ability to almost completely control consumers’ use of telecommunications networks. They have the ability to block individual content providers, enhance the performance of certain providers over others, monitor the overall telecommunications use of consumers, inject ads and other undesired content into the data stream between content providers and consumers, and much more. While not all ISPs engage in all of these behaviors, there are numerous examples of each that HAVE actually happened. The power ISPs exercise over consumers warrants a different and heightened regulatory structure separate from that of ordinary content providers. For these reasons I urge the commissioners to reject this proposal and revisit the idea of telecommunications governance with the goal of protecting consumers from abusive practices and not of advancing unsupported theories of deregulation with no proven benefit.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the high barrier of entry for an ISP and the regulations that protect them, ISPs are effectively limited monopolies in many areas in the US. Classifying them as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act ensures Americans  enjoy a free and open experience on the internet. While Title II does grant ISPs limited monopolies in some areas, it forces those ISPs to treat data equally, which benefits all users on the internet.\n If data is not treated equally we will lose the free market atmosphere of the internet because ISPs will be able to throttle or even block certain sites based on what the site owner and end users are willing to pay. The potential pay per view  or package models on the internet discourage discovery of new ideas or services and makes it difficult for small businesses and start ups to compete with large companies, because only large companies will be able to afford to get their site on a ""fast lane"" or in the ""basic package."" For the same reason, it will be possible to limit free speech on the internet by throttling or blocking sites with content the ISP does not agree with. This obstuction of free speech and press will be obscured under the guise of a ""business decision"" and users will have little recourse since there are few ISPs to choose from.\nThe core of what makes the internet so great is the instant communication it allows with almost anyone in the world. Protecting that sounds like a job for the FCC to me. Please do the right thing and protect net neutrality. In the modern era, our data is our voice, and everyone's voice deserves to be heard.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of ""unlimited"" internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules.

These are lies perpetuated by the telecommunications lobby in an effort to increase stock value fractions of a percent. Title II protection allows the Internet to exist in its current state. The FCC's job is to protect consumers from the vultures running large, corporate ISPs with little or no competition. If anything, AT&T and Comcast need to be broken up, a la Bell. The fact is, broadband prices haven't gone down since their very existence, so to suggest that removing regulations that promotes a fair and open internet will make prices cheaper is either: a) paying the cost of liberty and truth in exchange for better rates, or b) coming to a conclusion that has no evidence to support it. Either way, it's a bad idea and is terribly short-sighted. Anyone advocating for the opposite is simply under-informed. Politicians, ISPs, and shareholders of said ISPs are the only ones in the entirety of America to benefit from this policy of anti-neutrality.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network. \n\nI am also concerned about the limited choices many areas of the country have in terms of internet service. One argument in favor of letting ISPs control the speed of access to content is that, as consumers, we could force the hand of ISPs by choosing a different ISP that doesn't restrict speeds, i.e. 'letting the market decide'. This ignores the fact that ISPs in many areas have a virtual monopoly on service, so there is no alternative to defect to, leaving little incentive for the monopolistic ISPs to change their behavior.

The only ones who benefit from removing regulation are the ISP companies and the politicians that champion them; everyone else finds themselves without protection, security, and assurance of affordable internet access. Content providers find themselves with shrinking profits as they have to negotiate and pay fees to make their content available on a multitude of different networks, customers have to pay for access speeds comparable to poorer countries, and our data security and privacy goes straight in the dumpster. And then that dumpster gets set on fire.\n\nThis proposal doesn't intend to preserve liberty for the masses, it intends to improve the bottom line of companies. It is the textbook definition of cateringto special interests and sacrificing the freedoms of the may to benefit the few. It stands as an example of why the United States isn't even in the top 20 for residential internet speeds and will only worsen that gap.\n\nFurther, the American people don't want this kind of policy. In the lead up to the 2015 classification of ISPs as Common Carriers under Title II 60% of hte feedback supported the movement. Thats significantly more than a simple majority. I would wager that feedback from this will show overwhelming support for leaving the regulations in place.\n\nI implore you, take the will of the people into account and preserve the current measures for net neutrality and leave the classification from 2015 intact.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The internet, over the past couple of years, has shifted from being a luxury to a necessity in modern day life. It borders on being a public service. While I'm not asking for internet in the US to become free, in the monetary sense, I am asking the internet to remain as free, in the legal sense, as possible. Currently, some US citizen live in a situation where they have no option as to which ISP they can choose from. The fact that the US government lets situations like this exist is deplorable. In fact, I think the internet should function more like the electrical grid. Where companies can contribute to a grid and users can choose who ever they want to get their service from. Instead of the current system where users can only use a companies service if their wires are laid in their area already. But that is beside the point. Allowing ISP to throttle anyone they please will create an environment more restrictive than the aforementioned one. With the growing speed of the internet, anyone who wants to compete needs to provide their service just as fast. If, say, a small business wanted to conduct all of their business online, they would be dead in the water before they could make their first transaction if their service was throttled and they didn't have the money to pay for un-throttled internet. Now-a-days, if customer can't get their service here and now, they will move on to the next best thing. As an example, consider music streaming services like Bandcamp or Spotify. Throttling their services would make them effectively unusable, since the stream would take along time to buffer or even cut out during a song. In Bandcamp's case, downloads for larger file sizes would as become impractical and unrealistic. Note: one of the benefits to that site in particular, is the availability to download high quality music. Music that is much larger in terms of digital size but sounds better than what most others are providing. I feel that the only entities that could exist in a throttled internet environment are big corporate entities. Normally I don't like to make this type of argument, but the USA prides itself on being a nation where anyone can make it. To quote what's written on the Statue of Liberty, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"". It would be very Un-American to pass a law that made it difficult for anyone to be able to start their own business and make it in the modern day. Also, consider that a lot of big business today were once much smaller operations. While McDonald's has little to do with the internet, it was a single restaurant at one point that eventually grew into what it is today. The next McDonald's will not be able to take off without a free and open internet.\n\nAlso, just because it's called the ""Restoring Internet Freedom"" proposal, doesn't mean that's what it will actually do. This probably a moot point, but our leaders should not be in the business of manipulating language to fool the masses. Funny considering that has been the status quo for years now.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any type of law with a ""fast lane"" that can be paid for by corporations is 100% unfair. Furthermore, ISP's should 100% be treated as a utility. Since the cost to enter the market is so high there is very little competition and monopolies need to be regulated. I live in NYC and I only have one choice for internet TWC (now Spectrum). The internet speed they give me constantly changes, is completely unreliable and not even close to what they told me in the contract. Their excuse is the internet speed they give me is for wired connection only... That is very misleading and I do not believe for a second that they can't give me the same wireless speed with today's technology.  Yet, I do not have a choice to go to a competitor...","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is also important for the protection of internet users and internet service subscribers when it comes to consumer protection. Competition is extremely important for consumers to have fairly priced and high quality service. In the current information age the internet is not a luxury, it's a REQUIREMENT!

Furthermore, there are exorbitant costs for startup ISPs which makes it infeasible and there are federal and municipal regulations preventing competition. Much of the country only has a single serving ISP period. \n\nPlease keep the title 2 classification for internet service and preserve net neutrality. \n\nGutting net neutrality regulations is backwards and asinine, this is an industry that more then any other requires regulation. It would be utterly insane to propose that your phone service provider can charge you more or lower your audio quality based on what you are talking about or that your electrical or water supplier charge you more based on what you use your water or electricity for, yet that is exactly what net neutrality principals protect against from happening with your internet, and like water, electricity, and phone service, it is impossible to function in modern soceity without it, both for employment and engaging with the government for taxes and services.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network.

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stating that ""no such rule was needed"" does not follow from the fact that ""several large Internet service providers made it clear that that they did not engage in paid prioritization and had no plans to do so.""  These ISPs were operating in a different environment, in which the threat of future regulation may have altered their behavior and/or made them likely to comment on their (non)-plans.  They have an incentive to state that they had no plans to prioritize and it is concerning that the FCC's analysis is based simply on claims made by *any* interested party without critical examination.  There needs to be a much more thorough and extensive analysis of the likelihood of paid prioritization using rigorous inquiry, not face-value claims.\n\nRe: point 24, the proposal elides the distinction between Clinton era ""light-touch"" regulations, when the internet was in its infancy, and the effects of those that would operate on a much different internet space today.  As the internet has grown in value and scope, widespread reliance on it makes public utility regulation much more, not less, sensible.  The proposal's suggestion that a return the framework used to regulate a very different entity raises concerns about the analysis that underpins it.  What is to suggest that today's internet should be thought of along the same lines as the Clinton era internet?","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The internet, over the past couple of years, has shifted from being a luxury to a necessity in modern day life. It borders on being a public service. While I'm not asking for internet in the US to become free, in the monetary sense, I am asking the internet to remain as free, in the legal sense, as possible. Currently, some US citizen live in a situation where they have no option as to which ISP they can choose from. The fact that the US government lets situations like this exist is deplorable. In fact, I think the internet should function more like the electrical grid. Where companies can contribute to a grid and users can choose who ever they want to get their service from. Instead of the current system where users can only use a companies service if their wires are laid in their area already. But that is beside the point. Allowing ISP to throttle anyone they please will create an environment more restrictive than the aforementioned one. With the growing speed of the internet, anyone who wants to compete needs to provide their service just as fast. If, say, a small business wanted to conduct all of their business online, they would be dead in the water before they could make their first transaction if their service was throttled and they didn't have the money to pay for un-throttled internet. Now-a-days, if customer can't get their service here and now, they will move on to the next best thing. As an example, consider music streaming services like Bandcamp or Spotify. Throttling their services would make them effectively unusable, since the stream would take along time to buffer or even cut out during a song. In Bandcamp's case, downloads for larger file sizes would as become impractical and unrealistic. Note: one of the benefits to that site in particular, is the availability to download high quality music. Music that is much larger in terms of digital size but sounds better than what most others are providing. I feel that the only entities that could exist in a throttled internet environment are big corporate entities. Normally I don't like to make this type of argument, but the USA prides itself on being a nation where anyone can make it. To quote what's written on the Statue of Liberty, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"". It would be very Un-American to pass a law that made it difficult for anyone to be able to start their own business and make it in the modern day. Also, consider that a lot of big business today were once much smaller operations. While McDonald's has little to do with the internet, it was a single restaurant at one point that eventually grew into what it is today. The next McDonald's will not be able to take off without a free and open internet.\n\nAlso, just because it's called the ""Restoring Internet Freedom"" proposal, doesn't mean that's what it will actually do. This probably a moot point, but our leaders should not be in the business of manipulating language to fool the masses. Funny considering that has been the status quo for years now.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet.

How will that be true if only large, established companies can get a reliable, fast internet connection. How can the online market regulate itself, if ISP's are regulating it themselves.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the fundamental concept of capitalism, these companies are inclined to make decisions based on what makes them the most money, rather than what gives the end user the most freedom. There are currently numerous service providers that claim to provide ""infinite"" data plans, throttling bandwidth past a certain point. If network traffic is allowed to be throttled based on the site visited, these plans could be advertised even more misleadingly - a company could advertise infinite data without throttling, which is only true for specific websites that have bribed the ISP with boatloads of cash. ISPs are already making obscene amounts of money due to the ease of maintaining high-bandwidth infrastructure - do we really want to dump more of our hard-earned cash on them when they inevitably raise the prices based on their non-throttling claims?","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preserving net neutrality is imperative to the free market. Allowing telecom companies to have it their way would have massive repercussions that would affect everyone, from competitors to consumers - sans, of course, telecom companies and anti-neutrality politicians. Without the Title II rules and regulations, telecom corporations are given unchecked power and control over their customers' Internet access; there would be nothing to stop Comcast, for example, from throttling competitors by placing additional charges on their services or blocking their sites entirely in order to extort money from their customers. The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies to ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process. As such, I strongly disapprove of this proposal, and urge the FCC to reconsider its priorities in promoting corporate interests as opposed to those of its constituents.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So many aspects of it are integral to our lives: banking, utilities, information, booking of plane tickets, and untold amounts of merchandise.  The web has functioned so far as a free and open market in the most ideal sense - a level playing field.  Any tampering with net neutrality must be undertaken with the utmost care and consideration, as the consequences of it cannot really be predicted.  In simple terms I would say that it works now, and in fact is a vital part of commerce and communication, moreso than any other media at this time, and I would point out the obvious adage about not fixing that which is not broken.\n\nI am a small, independent businessman, and my livelihood depends on the free and open internet.  I am only one of what might be millions of entrepreneurs doing the same, and tampering with the unrestricted flow of information could have potentially dire economic consequences that cannot be accurately foreseen.  The high-speed internet business is already rife with monopoly and a lack of competition, and has given the service providers too much power as it stands.

The Internet is today's telephone; most communication takes place over it.  Common Carrier status was designed to protect consumers from efforts by providers to use their monopoly status to abuse consumers.\n\nI live and work in Silicon Valley.  At my home and at others nearby, there is only one internet provider that can provide internet access that meets the FCC's standard.  The telephone company does not offer DSL or 'fiber' access, or offers access that falls below the FCC's standard.  As a result, I must get my access from Comcast.  Comcast has treated us all abusively, including ignoring cancellation requests, billing for services that were not provided, raising rates by as much as 80% in a single day, pricing basic service at $70+ per month, adding services without permission, disconnecting internet when Cable TV bills are unpaid, and otherwise making internet access difficult, if not impossible, for those that depend on it for their livelihood.  These behaviors cannot be dealt with by the FCC if the providers do not have Common Carrier status. \n\nAnd then there's the issue of Net Neutrality.  I won't reiterate every point made by the EFF, though I agree with them wholeheartedly.  I will, however, speak to how loss of Net Neutrality would harm myself and my colleagues.  I wouldn't have a job if startups had to buy their way onto the internet, and neither would anyone at businesses that depend on startups.  Tomorrow's startups will require bandwidth, just as video streaming startups of today do.  T-Mobile restricts the maximum bandwidth of video streams unless consumers pay more to remove a per-stream cap.  This causes apps requiring HD-quality video to not work at all.  Internet video applications have attempted to circumvent this with traffic camouflaging so that they are treated fairly in comparison with other apps requiring similar bandwidth, but not using video streaming.  T-Mobile has fought this with additional methods of detecting video streaming.  In other words, they are restricting one use of the internet versus another based on content.  With the change you are proposing, home internet access could face similar restrictions, preventing unforeseen opportunities for startups in sectors where providers choose to throw up content-based or source-based restrictions or ""prioritization"".  *You could kill the next YouTube.*  THAT'S what we mean when we say you will harm innovation.  The Internet has been the great equalizer, giving startups access to consumers.  With the change you propose, that could come to an end.  You could kill the goose that laid the golden egg.  Don't let that happen.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Santiago","As the rise in usage and need gains in our society, being integrated into everything from tax and legal filings to networking and research I find it self-evident that the internet itself is quickly becoming a public necessity. Therefore it seems obvious that the internet is a public utility for the common good. On the surface we can easily see how in some ways the internet can be used for much more in the way of recreational activity, much like electricity. However it seems clear this is by determination of circumstance and offering one distinction to define and govern by such a narrow scope only stifles progress and freedom afforded by such a service which has so quickly become so much more. Furthermore allowing ""datacaps"" and bandwidth prioritization or ""fast lane/slow lane"" services only stifles competition and trade to other vendors besides internet service providers themselves. That is inherently a pay to play scheme and should be recognized as a deplorable act from the standpoint of any regulator or consumer. It is currently well known that under regulation of the FCC (as opposed to the FTC) we the consumers have better consumer rights and options and quite obviously prefer it that way. ""Data-mining"" or information gathering especially without consent or knowledge afforded to any party in question is not only a violation of their rights, but only affords them usually only advertisements either undesired or requested in the first place. Most especially given the consideration that any party in question is more often than not paying for said service directly. If information gathered is such a commodity in the first place, it isn't the service providers to sell and thus stolen and sold property. I would also argue that the majority of consumers would think and feel likewise on the matter. In totality and finality the internet does not belong to the providers and would not disappear as a service should the providers no longer remain as new ones and optimistically better providers would arise from the now already existing infrastructure in place to support the internet's existence. Thank you for any consideration and please for the sake of the public, the common person or any ""user"" keep the internet as a realm of freedom!","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.\n\nI know this has been copy-pasted, but the ideas here are real, and the proposed retraction of legislation is just as scary as it sounds.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules.

I do not understand the 'Restoring Internet Freedom' title as I felt that freedom was achieved with the 2015 FCC rules which the courts have basically supported, especially if under Title II. This latest effort appears to go backward and deregulates it again, letting ISP's determine pricing, on what & how high. \n\nSecondly, the FCC, who initiated these updated rules, has a proposed new chairman who is a former employee of a major ISP player.  The FCC is tasked with the just balancing of the needs and wants of both the ISP's and their customers. That does not require intimate industry knowledge but more of the hand of a judge, to be fair and impartial. Internet  customers do not need a FCC, with a biased chairman, and weakened regulations. This is no different than what any utility experiences and yes this new industry is a utility, one that is becoming more important everyday. The telephone business has been regulated during the majority of my life and it once was viewed similar as the ISP industry is today.\n\nI am a twenty year homeowner and initially set-up cable TV, and later internet service, with the local provider. Initially that ethernet was unrestricted in regard to speed or data. Speeds were slower then, but with system improvements they kept increasing. So much so, that it became a routine practice of mine to regularly unplug & reboot the cable modem to have the highest speeds. Yes these improvements cost the company money , but to me that is what capitalism is all about. Not controlling or forcing your customers to pay higher prices, but keeping them by having the best product. My personal shopping theory is look for the best product that I can afford, at the fairest price that I can find. \n\nThat last one, competition, is very important for Capitalism to work effectively. It is also hard to find with cable companies and is another reason for regulation. As Internet technology continued to improve and competition heated up, more access options became available via phone lines, satellites & eventually cell phones. Some of these were much cheaper but came with many more service or delivery issues. Although I thought the cable was highly priced, I remained loyal due to the quality.\n\nUnfortunately that quality started to deteriorate a little in service and speed.  I began to receive very regular, annoying solicitations that I could increase my speed for higher fees. At first I objected to this on principle, the reverse of a business practice, especially to a loyal customer. Overtime I came to realize from contact with sales or customer service agents, that my speed was becoming what they considered the absolute base minimal. However I could not afford to remedy that. Eight years ago I retired on fixed income, when my company closed during the recession, and I had to try to reduce my budget by 50-60%. I eliminated cable TV, landline phone & did not replace my TV when it died. I anxiously deliberated over every expense, including internet & cell service. It seemed to be expense versus luxury. Or could it help my wife & I, as seniors, to stay connected & active in the future, even as we aged more. I timidly retained them, but for the lowest prices offered.\n\nAfter retirement my life has become very interconnected with and dependent upon the internet. It has helped me to connect and engage with the world in a completely new way, opening all kinds of possibilities, and changing my life in unbelievable ways. I use the net for a multitude of purposes. Through the net is how I receive and respond to the majority of my correspondence, both personal & business.  I have tried to stop all paper mail, which does not follow well  when we are away in the RV. We research on the web, from future trips, to medical issues, to shopping. We purchase online. We have volunteer jobs on line. We look forward to the possibilities of small online businesses that we can maintain while still in the RV.  I belief my wife & I would be very negatively impacted by any further loss of speed, additional fees & costs, or restrictions to our use of of the web. \n\nAs a retired senior, on fixed income, I cannot afford to regularly pay more for internet service. This is why government regulation was ever started, corporations can be so intent, even legally, on maximizing profit, they can immorally deny service, or squeeze dollars from, in whole or in part, from their lower income customer bases, especially seniors. The FCC Open Internet Rules  are extremely important to me. I urge you to resolutely protect them.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These Net Neutrality rules were established to maintain a free and fair internet for everyone, from Comcast to new start ups. Reversing these rules will lead to even greater cost to the public as companies like Netflix return to throttling their content and ""offering pay more"" options for services that should be and are standard today. Moreover, far too many areas in the nation have only a single option for broadband ISP services. With these monopolies in place, the ISP's, which already make their own prices without competition, can increase their prices even further, potentially setting up even more ""tiers"" for connection service, further making essential broadband services out of reach for far too many American's.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Back to the Internet, the proposed net neutrality plans are a bad idea since no corporation should be allowed to pick the winners and losers online. Why would major corporations allow any small business the same Internet speeds as themselves and other big time players. Again, please do your jobs.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules.
