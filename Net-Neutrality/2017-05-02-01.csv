I urge you to protect them.\r\n\r\nMost Americans only have one choice for true high speed Internet access: our local cable company. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:\r\n\r\n* Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""\r\n* Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)\r\n* Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")\r\n\r\nThey're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\r\n\r\nTo my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.\r\n\r\nTo my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me.

In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network. The importance of net neutrality cannot be understated. Imagine if car manufacturers were the ones who decided what roads could be used and when.

I am a high school student, novice coder, computer enthusiast, all around nerd, and much more. \r\nTo allow the FCC to repeal net neutrality would be devastating to my generation. We would not be able to make choice about content consumed, how much we pay for it, and much more! \r\nIn fact, the only ISP in my area of Seattle is Comcast. If Comcast wanted us to vote a certain way on a referendum or measure, they could manipulate what we saw online, prevent us from viewing information that  may not support or even may show that their view could be completely to their benefit! \r\nIf Comcast wanted us to pay them to watch Netflix, which we already pay for, they could block the site or throttle (slow down the connection) it to the point that we have to pay to make it usable. This would allow Comcast to charge whatever they wanted just to let us use simple services!\r\nBefore I end this, i would like to offer you, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, the ability to use this in a speech or anything to convince others to support this position. I would also be willing to make a speech of my own if the opportunity was presented to me. Another final word of advice: to the representative that claimed that ""you don't need the internet"", challenge him to perform all of his necessary duties as a representative without using any cell phone, internet connected computer, or tablet for a month. To transfer data or talk, he would have to use a landline, federal mail services, or a thumb drive.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet.

I would support a new regulation style if it guarantees the same, or better, protections that are in place now, but not if we lose any.  \n\nIn addition, Paragraph 82 asks for input on whether throttling should be regulated. In the past, Internet service providers have, on record, throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn't it possible that the Internet service providers, once again, would throttle these types of content and plausibly more? With streaming services becoming more and more mainstream, content throttling would devastate customer satisfaction towards both the Internet service providers and the streaming services. To add, if Internet service providers are not held to regulation of throttling content, as they currently are, innovation of Internet infrastructure  may continue to slow as there would be no incentive to improve the infrastructure to provide better speeds to customers.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is it healthy for the competition for big businesses to limit the amount of power you can use on products that aren't theirs?\n\nIf you answered no to any of these, then you should protect Net Neutrality.

Preserving net neutrality is imperative to the free market. Allowing telecom companies to have it their way would have massive repercussions that would affect everyone, from competitors to consumers - sans, of course, telecom companies and anti-neutrality politicians. Without the Title II rules and regulations, telecom corporations are given unchecked power and control over their customers' Internet access; there would be nothing to stop Comcast, for example, from throttling competitors by placing additional charges on their services or blocking their sites entirely in order to extort money from their customers. The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies to ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process. As such, I strongly disapprove of this proposal, and urge the FCC to reconsider its priorities in promoting corporate interests as opposed to those of its constituents.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.

ISPs have mentioned a return to the 2010 Open Internet Order, which favored ISPs regarding technicalities in official name/service.  ISPs were held to rules/regulations but were not officially considered Common Carriers, thus allowing courts to favor ISPs based on arbitrary gray area (via official name/category) and the FCC losing.  That's an illusion of consumer protection that isn't justified to anybody but the respective companies running the internet.  Based on previous behavior from ISPs and throttling content based on their own determination of what was lawful or not, why wouldn't they do it again once the 2015 Title II designation is gone?  The buck stops with the FCC to keep consumers protected in practice, not as an illusion.  Thanks for reading my comment.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe the incentives of ISPs would not be well-aligned with the interests of the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, and lobbying cities and state governments to prevent municipalities from giving their residents high-speed internet. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. I also believe the main argument for undoing net neutrality--that it will encourage innovation--is completely untrue. Saying an open internet will hinder innovation in technology is like saying publicly subsidized drinkable tap water is a hindrance to food and beverage innovation. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication (not to mention America's position as the best place in the world in which to start a company).","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We need to maintain the neutrality, data is data and as such it should be treated equally no matter what the content is or who owns it. \n\nIn other countries throttling and zero rating are are already changing behaviors and altering how people navigate the Internet. In some cases Zero rating for Facebook, Whatsapp or Twitter keeps people consuming only those applications and not even considering browsing the Internet for more information, as they don't have the incentive to spend money and leave the mentioned services.\n\nIt's also not fair that some companies can prioritize their content because they have plenty of money while thousands of startups or small businesses get less speed or bandwidth because of their condition; that's a new source of inequality that we can't allow.\n\nTelecom and cable broadband corporations just want to profit over the Internet with the new model proposed, well guess what, no thank you. They are already slowing you down with nonsense data caps (not existing in the past). They raise your prices unilaterally for no reason (did it to me twice in one year to reach a 33% increase of my data plan).\n\nThey are already making tons of money and Just look at the data: USA's broadband speed doesn't even make top 10 in the world. However the prices are some of the most expensive ones. Internet access: Almost 80 million people in the US don't have access according to World Bank Data 2015 (26% of the country).

It will only generate profits for the corps at the direct costs of the consumers. Pretending it is anything else is the worst kind of lie. ISPs have already shown, in legal testimony even, that they are ready and willing to bend rules to limit speeds of competition, establish monopolistic market policies, and screw over paying customers time and time again. By deregulating the consumer protections in place - currently called 'net neutrality' - you will open the door for all these abuses to run unchecked. This will destroy the market and directly harm the consumer. If you even pretend to care about internet freedom and equality, you'll drop this proposal like the steaming pile of bull that it so clearly is.\n\nI hope you hear the voice of common sense here, and abandon this plan to give a bunch of unethical companies the chance to do whatever they like without oversight. they aren't to be trusted, and honestly, if the FCC plans to allow this sort of abuse, neither should you.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs.

I'm concerned that changes to the current classification could harm the equality of sites on the Internet -- as all sites should be able to be accessed freely without any throttling or censorship. I'm also very worried that ISPs or mobile companies or Internet providers may try to throttle sites and force them to pay them extra fees to get basic service for Internet usage. That's discrimination -- as all sites should have equal access to the Internet and not have to pay extra fees for their site to be able to load at all.

Selling our freedom to big corporations is absolutely unacceptable. There's something called the first amendment in this country, and if you allow corporations such as these to take over our freedom of information, what does that say about our democracy, our freedom and our Constitution? We have all seen the effects of this monopoly in the mainstream media, which has now been sold down the river to six big corporations.  Choosing profits over people is about as undemocratic as you can get. I don't know how you can sit as the head of the FCC and pretend that you believe in democracy, whilst trying to sell Americans freedom of information to the highest bidder.  Your brand of capitalism will never survive in this country, and it is currently a dying system, because if you have people who do not have jobs, and do not have income, how are they supposed to spend money to grow the economy & buy the products these corporations are selling?\nYou take away these freedoms and allow these corporations to charge anything they desire for our Internet, then people simply will not purchase it. Every time something gets privatized and the prices get excessively raised, people just stop buying. What you and your DC bubble, and big corporations, do not seem to understand, is that the people in this country (50% of which are living as poor or in poverty), simply will not be able to afford the services if sold off to a few big corporations.  I suggest you leave net neutrality alone, and stop trying to come up with new ways to destroy the average American. I guarantee that if you bothered to ask the American people what they want, they would strongly oppose your proposal and chose net neutrality any day of the week.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet.

In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network. Most concerning is what appears to be the callous, disingenuous or at worst naive approach that this proposal has been voiced. Those that are responsible to protect the common good should think about the legacy we are leaving our children. I implore you to be honest in protecting consumers. Competition keeps us strong and stable. Monopolies have historically served only the few and fed the worst of human traits, greed. Please do the right thing.

I am a high school student, novice coder, computer enthusiast, all around nerd, and much more. \r\nTo allow the FCC to repeal net neutrality would be devastating to my generation. We would not be able to make choice about content consumed, how much we pay for it, and much more! \r\nIn fact, the only ISP in my area of Seattle is Comcast. If Comcast wanted us to vote a certain way on a referendum or measure, they could manipulate what we saw online, prevent us from viewing information that  may not support or even may show that their view could be completely to their benefit! \r\nIf Comcast wanted us to pay them to watch Netflix, which we already pay for, they could block the site or throttle (slow down the connection) it to the point that we have to pay to make it usable. This would allow Comcast to charge whatever they wanted just to let us use simple services!\r\nBefore I end this, i would like to offer you, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, the ability to use this in a speech or anything to convince others to support this position. I would also be willing to make a speech of my own if the opportunity was presented to me. Another final word of advice: to the representative that claimed that ""you don't need the internet"", challenge him to perform all of his necessary duties as a representative without using any cell phone, internet connected computer, or tablet for a month. To transfer data or talk, he would have to use a landline, federal mail services, or a thumb drive.

An open and accessible internet is vital if the US wishes to maintain its economic position in the future. A restricted internet will strangle the many small businesses which depend on online transactions and will have a chilling effect on entrepreneurship and technological innovation. Furthermore, the internet has become a vital public platform for social interaction. Allowing service providers to price-gate internet access will create and exacerbate social divides and inequalities. The move to damage net neutrality is badly out of tune with the future we're headed towards, and if enacted, will severely damage the US' stake in that future. If anything, I believe the consumer protection afforded by net neutrality should be strengthened and expanded.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You speak of reducing government control of the internet by reducing regulations but you do not say that your proposal gives more control to Corporations. The FCCs duty is to protect the Consumer, not Corporations. The FCC should protect net neutrality. Do not give more power and control to Corporations which control access to free-flowing information. Internet access is a necessity and consumers fair access to it should be protected by the FCC. Internet access should not be monopolized, price-jacked or chosen by internet providers. Do not allow service provider Corporations (which already have a monopoly or limited competition in many areas) prioritize certain distributors over others for their own profits.

I agree wholeheartedly with the many organizations who wrote to Commission Chairman Pai and US Senators Thune and Nelson in March: ""Protecting net neutrality is crucial to ensuring that the internet remains a central driver of economic growth and opportunity, job creation, education, free expression, and civic organizing for everyone. The principles of net neutrality – that all data on the internet should be treated equally, and internet service providers (ISPs) should not discriminate or provide preference to any data, regardless of its source, content, or destination – are the foundation that has made the internet the engine of opportunity it is today. The continuation of net neutrality is essential to the continued growth of the country and to ensuring access to social, political, and economic empowerment for all.""\n\nWe should be working to ensure that everyone throughout the United States has easy, equal, and affordable access to the internet, which has become an indispensable part of modern life. Part of that includes allowing startups and other small businesses to compete on equal footing with larger, established companies. Equal access to these freedoms is a large reason the United States has so many successful internet-based companies. Squashing this innovation would be harmful for both small business owners and for the economy in general. I believe it also goes against the core values of freedom of expression and equality of access that have made the United States great.\n\nThank you!","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preserving net neutrality is imperative to the free market. Allowing telecom companies to have it their way would have massive repercussions that would affect everyone, from competitors to consumers - sans, of course, telecom companies and anti-neutrality politicians. Without the Title II rules and regulations, telecom corporations are given unchecked power and control over their customers' Internet access; there would be nothing to stop Comcast, for example, from throttling competitors by placing additional charges on their services or blocking their sites entirely in order to extort money from their customers. The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies to ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process.

If broadband innovation has been ""stifled"", this is the fault of broadband companies wasting tax payer money earmarked for building up the fiber infrastructure in this country. These companies have regional monopolies and there is little to no competition forcing consumers to pay a premium. Power companies cannot block or throttle your electricity if they believe you are using it frivolously - likewise with water. Additionally, they cannot double bill both a company and a consumer for the same connection. The United States lags behind most first-world nations in their implementation of a full-fiber network and allowing these ISPs to continue charging excessively without innovating will cause economic damage and make it difficult for American citizens and businesses to compete globally and locally.

Donovan","Dir Sir or Madam -\n\n17-108 is a terrible plan and will serve to make the Internet less useful, less usable, and less of a transforming force than it could or should be.\n\nI have been a professional network engineer engaged in building and maintaining the Internet since 1993, working with groups ranging from startup companies to Fortune 100 companies; for a time, several of the largest websites in the world were hosted on networks I maintained.  So I speak with substantial knowledge of how the Internet works, and moreover why it works.  I have been involved in questions of how traffic should get routed and worked to make that happen, and I've seen the balance between business and technical decisions.  \n\nOne of the things that helped foster the telephone system, which powered the growth of the United States in business and as a country, was the idea that telephone networks should be ""common carriers"" - for the internet, this concept is called ""net neutrality"".  And 17-108 will destroy it and lead to a broken Internet that will be worse for consumers.\n\nThank you for your consideration in this matter.\n\nRegards,\n\nRegis M.

This is liberty and freedom that you're tarnishing. We will utilize democracy to loudly voice our dissatisfaction. If you proceed with your proposals with a vote, you will face immense grassroots resistance even if you ignore us. We won't stop until this injustice is quelled. Don't touch our internet.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules.

Solid infrastructure is necessary to a healthy economy. It allows growth and innovation, and keeps us competitive on the world stage. Losing it poses a threat to America's economic well-being. Internet Service Providers (and those who fund/support them) will be able to pick and chose winners in the market by denying them access to customers and removing their ability to communicate and coordinate. This is the exact opposite of a free market. We lose the benefits of competition and gain nothing but negativity. They will be able to control access to news and resources. They will censor critics. They will strangle those who do not agree to their terms. Politicians will be able to silence opposition by helping/paying these service providers. The politicians that do this may be your opposition. Even worse, they may win with these corrupt tactics. Losing Net Neutrality is signing away our freedom and economic well-being. Supporting the push to end it is putting short term gain for a few over the health of this nation.\r\n\r\nAs a constituent and an American who cares for the future of my country, I will be watching the results of these votes. I cannot, and will not, in good conscious support any politician who throws away their sacred duty to represent my and my fellow American's best interests. I will vote against you.

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is it healthy for the competition for big businesses to limit the amount of power you can use on products that aren't theirs?\n\nIf you answered no to any of these, then you should protect Net Neutrality.

Indeed, even now Internet service across the country varies in different regions, depending on what companies offer their services in a given area and what prices they choose to charge for varying broadband speeds. To give these companies further power to charge differing amounts or change download/upload speeds dependant on what sites their consumers visit is a gross misunderstanding of what the Internet is. The Internet is not a simple commodity that exists only for entertainment or to fully serve U.S. citizens with the largest wallets. It exists as a source of information and connection for all Americans. To put this in perspective, think of the students of America. When was the last time a child, young adult, or career-driven citizen was dependant solely on books to write a paper? A thesis? A dissertation? A proposal? To mandate that only the richest families in America should have unbridled access to the greatest educational tool of our time clearly serves to further segregate the population of the United States across class lines and further disintegrate our freedom. An informed populace is a freer populace. And what of the daughter of a U.S. military serviceman? Should she not be able to communicate with a father whose life is on the line overseas? Or should this irreplaceable bond between father and child be degraded because her mother—who works multiple jobs—had to choose between paying for heat in the winter or paying for greater access to video call services through her broadband provider, which only months before was ""freely"" included as part of an already exuberant subscription package? The Internet is a figurative (and perhaps literal) window to the world. Don't limit your citizens' ability to open that window due to their income, lest you make them desperate for air.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's my understanding that the FCC Chairman intends to reverse net neutrality rules and put big Internet Service Providers in charge of the internet. I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.  As someone who works in an industry centered around technology, I would ask one thing of those who fight against the true freedom of the internet.  The internet is already free, let's keep it that way!  Thank you for taking the time to read this through.  I hope you will look at this without only seeing the bad in the world.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication. Americans are quite limited in their choices for true high speed Internet access. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to: Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees"", Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds), Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"").

US ISP's have proven time and time again that they operate with impunity and minimal competition in a service (internet access) that is critical to many areas of modern life.  I worked at an ISP for 10 years, and they are in no way put in to some unfair disadvantage by net neutrality and title II.  In fact those protections are needed specifically because of the rhetoric and actions of those ISP's.  The US, which is the birthplace of the internet, is falling further and further behind other developed nations because the major ISP's are allowed to strong arm any potential competition, thus ensuring they can continue to raise prices on unchanged services with minimal future investment.  If this was solely a case of their network/their rules, that might be one thing, but US tax payers have contributed vast amounts of resources to allow these ISP's to build their networks through tax credits, service fees, grants, and favorable access rights.  The current rules as written still don't go far enough to protect citizens from predatory ISP's, but removing those protections will do significant harm to those least capable of defending themselves (the citizens).  I am strongly opposed to the weakening of net neutrality and removal of title II.  Voluntary promises from ISP's are a terrible idea, as history has proven time and time again.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The internet today has grown far and beyond what it was in the early days.  The Title II classification was made necessary because certain large internet providers could no longer be trusted to maintain fairness in how they handle data, by attempting to prioritize the data of those who are wealthy enough to pay for special treatment.  This unfairly impacts small businesses and individual users who would use the internet's primary defining attribute and the biggest reason for its growth and impact: Free and open communication.   When I signed up for internet in Seattle several years ago, I had only one choice in provider.  The city was (and may still be) divided into regions which were assigned to different internet providers, much like a utility.  I literally had no way to choose who I did business with.   This argument that regulation wasn't needed when the internet was young, and therefore isn't needed today is utter nonsense.   It is the FCC's job to ensure these near-monopolies operate on the level and do not abuse their power for profit.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's name is a flat out lie.  This bill will allow the network provider to block sites, or redirect to someone who pays them to direct you to them, with no freedom at all.  New goods and services will be expected to pay to play, so not only will you pay to have net access, but the provider will have to pay to access you.  Increasing the amount of money we will have to pay to stream video, or buy goods, because the internet provider will want to charge them also, for what we the consumer have already paid for.  Not even the phone company could charge both parties for a long distance call, in the past.  Now this bill will allow your ISP the one you pay for it block your bank if thy don't like them, or if they refuse to pay... again for something you already pay for.  Maybe they will strike a deal and you will be limited to one store, so much for free market.   In many places we are limited to one ISP, we have only access to one highspeeen provider.

The success of the internet lives and dies on the back of free, open, unrestricted, equal, and fair distribution of data, regardless of subject matter.  The current chairman's proposal to demolish these net neutrality rules are incredibly short sighted, unashamedly anti-consumer, and unarguably in favor of corporation protectionism.  Removing these net neutrality rules opens the doors for the proven untrustworthy and arguably ""evil"" ISP's (Internet Service Providers) to further exploit consumers while delivering sub-par service nation-wide.  The current chairman's arguments of the current rules 'stifling innovation and hurting jobs' are baseless and unfounded.  Innovations need to be made in delivering content faster, more efficiently, and with less cost.  A nation without net neutrality would let ISPs 'innovate' to create internet slow lanes & toll roads, with more fees and costs;  all of which many of the national and large regional ISPs have already attempted in the past.  The internet was created to allow more efficient exchange of information.  To allow the current ISPs to control and modify how that works is tantamount to censorship.  The internet should be open, free, unbiased, and fair.  As it was created, and as it should remain.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They may try other sites, taking opportunity away from that business.\n\nIf the business we are talking about is a media organisation, this isolation will impact Freedom of the Press.\n\nIf the business is a technology company offering services, this will impact consumer choice.\n\nIf the business is a services firm operating in the US, this will impact the services the US can offer the world, and impact jobs, growth, innovation.\n\nI call upon the FCC to reconsider this dire proposal, as it not only affects the USA, but the entire world.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs.

I \n\n\nIt's my understanding that the FCC Chairman intends to reverse net neutrality rules and put big Internet Service Providers in charge of the internet. I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.\n\n!","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ISPs have too much market power, face little competition if any in areas they serve, and have a history of abusing their market power. ISPs must not be allowed to operate using our scarce resources without regulatory oversight. They are not trustworthy and have earned that reputation based on their past behavior. The FCC is foolish to think a hands off approach and voluntary restraint will prevent ISP businesses from abusing their enormous market power. The FCC must put aside its ideology and deal with the reality presented by past behavior and likelihood of the same going forward from ISPs. Do NOT be so naive that ISPs will self regulate.

I am firmly against this action, and believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.\n\nI also believe that this submission process should be revised, as I view having to publicly disclose my personal information in order to have a say in my democracy as an abhorrent attempt to stifle my civic duty to engage.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a small business owner and I am concerned that these actions will negatively affect competition and eventually increase my costs as a customer of the large ISP's. I can not run my business without internet. I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You speak of reducing government control of the internet by reducing regulations but you do not say that your proposal gives more control to Corporations.  The FCCs duty is to protect the Consumer, not Corporations.  The FCC should protect net neutrality.  Do not give more power and control to Corporations which control access to free-flowing information.  Internet access is a necessity and consumers fair access to it should be protected by the FCC.  Internet access should not be monopolized, price-jacked or chosen by internet providers.  Do not allow service provider Corporations (which already have a monopoly or limited competition in many areas) prioritize certain distributors over others for their own profits.

ISPs are a monopoly (I have only one broadband choice), and therefore require regulation to prevent them from taking advantage of  their monopoly status. Additionally most of the large ISPs, including mine, are also providing content via cable TV etc. Allowing the ISPs to control what I have access to on the internet, and the quality of that access, is an outrageous thing to do. \n\nIt is simply another example of how money is easily able to buy access and control of the government.

I urge you to protect them. Citizens of the United States deserve to have fair, open, competitive use of the resource that is the World Wide Web.  The open playground for innovation has been key in the growth of the US economy over the last 20 years. Do not let the interests of sole business with large pockets stifle the collective spirit of this free nation.\r\n\r\nMost Americans only have one choice for true high speed Internet access: our local cable company. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:\r\n\r\n* Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""\r\n* Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)\r\n* Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")\r\n\r\nThey're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\r\n\r\nTo my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people.

The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-neutrality, anti-free market, and anti-consumer.

In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet.

Sunday morning while letting the dogs out I realized the outage was due to a branch taking out the wires leading to the house. After contacting Comcast again at 9am, since the wire was across my whole back yard & my home security was linked to the internet, they stated they would dispatch a tech out immediately because this was of high priority. I even got the order #041777952. At 4 pm I called back to get eta of the tech & was told they were coming out Tuesday & they don't do same day appt. I asked why I was promised same day appts the guy stated 'The other girl probably just told you what you wanted to hear'. I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor Oscar empl #9962 who also stated they don't do same day appt & it would have to wait. He also stated I would have to 'prove' that the service had been out to get any kind of credit for having no service even though they knew at their end there was an issue with connection. I addressed with him the security system failure & hazard of the wire across the back yard & what to do with it considering having dogs that needed to be let out, he made a snide comment about the dogs under his breath but wouldn't repeat what he had said and told me 'nevermind'.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Far from restoring internet freedom, this would effectively gut net neutrality. Preserving net neutrality is imperative to the free market. Allowing telecom companies to have it their way would have massive repercussions that would affect everyone, from competitors to consumers. Without the Title II rules and regulations, telecom corporations are given unchecked power and control over their customers' Internet access; there would be nothing to stop Comcast, for example, from throttling competitors by placing additional charges on their services or blocking their sites entirely in order to extort money from their customers. The American consumer stands to gain absolutely nothing by supporting this proposal. It is anti-freedom, anti-free market, anti-small-business, and anti-consumer. It does not promote the rights of consumers, it gives telecom companies to ability to unfairly crush competition whilst shafting their customers in the process. As such, I strongly disapprove of this proposal, and urge the FCC to reconsider its priorities in promoting corporate interests as opposed to those of its constituents.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet.

Net neutrality ensures that everyone - whether a researcher, attorney, self-represented litigant, small business owner, or student - has a consistent and reliable way of accessing information online.   The nature of the web also gives the public the ability to find critical information on current events and politics, enabling more informed participation in the democratic process.  Allowing any broadband providers to stifle, throttle, or divert consumers to sites based purely on which company can pay the highest fee only adds to the information bias problems we already see on the web and allows those companies to shape and mold public discourse to their own ends.  \n\nAdditionally, it increases the chances that particular companies will create monopolies by using their deep pockets to divert users away from smaller competitors to remove competition.  That influence should be the result of effective advertising of quality goods and services, NOT cutting off access to competitors.  \n\nThe FCC conducted a long and thorough rulemaking to come up with the current net neutrality rules, and the rules must be preserved.\n\nPlease do not vote to enact this regulation.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:\r\n\r\n* Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""\r\n* Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)\r\n* Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")\r\n\r\nThey're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\r\n\r\nTo my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.\r\n\r\nTo my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me.

These ensure a fair & open internet for all. What exists is currently in the best interest of the American people. The only reason to try to repeal this is due to political ideology (which is childish), or to allow ISPs to take advantage of Americans, charge additional fees, censor, paid prioritization, or restrict access. We already don't have a choice in ISPs for high speed internet in this country (due to government granted monopolies and collusion within the ISPs themselves - why don't you legislate THAT problem?). I realize that these massive companies are funneling money into our politicians (and Pai doesn't realize he doesn't work for Verizon anymore and his boss(es) are the citizens of this country) so they can take advantage of all of us but it would be nice if for once our government stood up for what's in the best interest of the American people. You just sold us out by allowing ISPs to sell off our personal internet history, how much more damage are you trying to do to us for your own personal gain? There has been no harm from implementing these rules and this is not an example of  unnecessary ""government regulation"".

I do not see any way in which it substantially protects consumer interests, or online businesses' fair access to customers. Instead, it allows ISP's to unfairly pick and choose which content to privilege on their networks, limiting the ability of online businesses to compete with ISPs' own content, as well as compete with online businesses that can afford to cut deals. This proposal deeply favors businesses with more money, the ISP's themselves (many of which have their own content networks that they desperately would like to give preferential treatment), and will therefore stifle online competition, innovation, and consumer choice. I can't put it any more simply than that.\n\nWithout strong net neutrality rules, we have already seen numerous abuses by ISP's that were clearly anti-competitive and anti-consumer. A particularly egregious example is in 2012 when Comcast wanted to make it so their own Xbox app didn't count against their customers' data caps, but competing apps would. This is a clear example of company controlling both the content and distribution network using their power to stifle competition unfairly. It is no surprise that consumers got fed up and asked for ISPs to be classified under Title II.\n\nIn our country, the big cable ISPs are natural monopolies, and represent most home internet traffic because they are the fastest and most reliable providers in most areas and do not compete in each others' territory and lobby local governments extensively to stifle competition. If you do away with net neutrality rules, most Americans will no longer have access to a free and open internet where all content is accessible and all businesses compete fairly. Please preserve the wonderful and democratic nature of the internet for future generations.\n\nThank you,\nWilliam Makley","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.\n\nThe FCC Chairman intends to reverse net neutrality rules and to allow internet providers to determine what content is allowed on the internet. I am against this action. Allowing internet providers to be the gatekeepers of the public internet will increase censorship, decrease opportunities and destroy our freedoms. Among the most cherished of our liberties is our freedom of speech. The internet providers should be regulated in the same way that our telephone lines and our printed mediums are regulated -- with the idea that our freedoms will never be infringed. These public utilities should continue to be overseen by the agency that will enforce the public interests and this includes protecting our freedom of speech and freedom of commerce. By removing the restrictions of net neutrality, internet providers will have free reign to censor competitors through price controls, to censor its own customers through exclusions of content and to censor the very idea of our freedom of speech through their own actions. Internet providers have already put these ideas into practice through actions that are similar in nature to these. They have lobbied governments to restrict community-based internet, they have required Netflix and other content providers to pay higher prices for internet access, they have redirected domain lookup results to their own websites, they have implemented the idea of ""bandwidth caps"" and they have stated that they intend to do more than this. The internet is a required utility for any 21st century business. The very notion that a new startup -- such as Sears -- could operate solely by mail-order would be laughable today. In order for America to proceed into modern times and to compete successfully against the global economy, we must have a fair and open internet free from any constraints. This necessarily requires oversight of the internet providers and the prompt enforcement of our liberties -- the greatest of all is our freedom of speech.\n\nIf Ajit Pai is allowed to do this, he will be literally destroying the internet as a fair and level playing field. You wouldn't allow the US Post Office to intentionally slow service to, or outright refuse to deliver letters or packages to someone based on where that package was purchased, the contents, or where it was going, so why is it acceptable to let Internet Service Providers do exactly that?","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no reason for me to chronicle the many, many examples of how the ""free market"" ISPs control have failed the american people time and time again. Being the FCC, there is no doubt in my mind that the dubious history of US ISPs is well known by you. I also have no doubt that an uncountable number of american citizens have pointed out the shame you should be feeling for your current actions. I am sure the effort is wasted on you. My suggestions to you regarding proceeding 17-108, dubiously called ""Restoring Internet Freedom"", is to scrap it in its current form. It is, for the most part, unusable. Instead, I would include provisions that require, or seek to foster, true competition between ISPs. The mafia-esque manner in which they have carved up this country can in no way be considered competition. Open and fair competition between websites and companies using the internet should be made sacred, contrary to the current attempt to allow ISPs to tax growing companies and small business for the privilege of joining the ""express lane"". In addition, ISP pricing transparency is a necessity. I fear for us, I really do. What you are doing cannot be forgiven. I hope that you have it within you to reconsider. However, this is only the opinion of a concerned citizen. I'm not sure how much that will truly mean to you.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: * deliberately throttling internet traffic * squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps * misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet * giving privileged treatment to companies they own * strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet * avoiding real competition at all costs Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet.

Throttling and fee-based traffic prioritization has significant negative impacts both on early stage businesses and consumers.   It creates an anti-competitive environment in which established players with funding available to pay to prioritize their traffic are able to reach audiences far more effectively than startups small businesses.  Given that, as of 2015, small to medium sized software firms accounted for 7 percent of US GDP  and 11.5 percent of private sector employment in the US (https://www.selectusa.gov/software-and-information-technology-services-industry-united-states), any move which raises the cost of market entry and increases the difficulty of disruptive innovation is likely to result in wide ranging, negative economic impacts.  \n\nFurthermore, the innovations that result from such innovative economic activity deliver enormous benefits to consumers  in the forms of increased choice and access to solutions and services that meet the changing needs of a digital society.  To suggest that stifling innovative small businesses somehow protects consumers is fallacious at best and dangerous at worst as the rollback of network neutrality rules will dramatically reduce consumer choice and access to innovative product offerings from small businesses while at the same time hamstringing one of the most rapidly growing and important industries in the nation.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eliminating these protections will only drown them in worse conditions with access to cyber-infrastructure. Having been ruled by monopolies for decades, cutting more consumer protections is a spit in the face to the so proposed 'freedom,' which is given to companies such as Comcast, Frontier, and Time Warner Cable-Charter, who have monopolized and enforced agreed upon districting that has lead to no competition in our state. With no options to promote market competition, these will simply help line the pockets of the companies, that have ensured no competition, so that they can maximize profits over consumer wants and needs when gaining access to internet services. Paragraph 82 asks for input on whether throttling should be regulated. In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. With this proposement, I fear that we will simply be walking back on ourselves, and allow the companies that provide these services to believe it is right again.

I urge you to protect them.\r\n\r\nMost Americans only have one choice for true high speed Internet access: our local cable company. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:\r\n\r\n* Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""\r\n* Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)\r\n* Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")\r\n\r\nThey're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\r\n\r\nTo my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.\r\n\r\nTo my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me.

Circuit’s decision in the Verizon case dealt a huge blow to the open Internet.\n\nRight now there is no one protecting Internet users from ISPs that block or discriminate against websites, applications or services. Companies like Verizon will now be able to block or slow down any website, application or service they like. And they’ll be able to create tiered pricing structures with fast lanes for those who can afford the tolls and slow lanes for everyone else.\n\nThis decision will be devastating for independent entrepreneurs, impoverished individuals, and small content creators. The internet is a necessary communication tool in today's society. For people who work online, they may now have to decide between paying for fast-lane service and groceries. This is wrong. \n\nIt’s time for the new FCC leadership to correct the agency’s past mistakes and to reassert the agency’s clear authority over our nation’s communications infrastructure. To preserve the open Internet, the FCC must reclassify broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service.\n\nUse your authority to establish a solid legal footing for the vital policies and protections this court decision threatens.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of America’s startup ecosystem depends on an open Internet — including enforceable net neutrality rules that ensure big cable companies can’t discriminate against startups. \n\nIf net neutrality regulations are dismantled, it’s difficult to predict exactly how ISPs will behave, but we do know how they behave relative to another communication network technology- cable television. These same companies control cable TV, and charge both sides of the network. On one side of the network, they only carry content providers who pay them large sums of cash and equity, and on the other side of the network, they offer more channels to customers who pay higher rates than others. Were the current net neutrality rules against blocking, throttling and paid prioritization of data to be lifted, ISPs would have the ability to determine which content providers can have access to their networks (as they do now with cable TV channels), and what content its consumers have access to (as they do now with cable TV packages).\n\nWithout net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the Internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market. They could impede traffic from startup services in order to favor their own services or established competitors. The unavoidable result will be stifled innovation, as there would no longer exist a monetary incentive to launch an internet startup, and without a monetary incentive there would be no ability to attract investment capital.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I urge you to protect them.\r\n\r\nMost Americans only have one choice for true high speed Internet access: our local cable company. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:\r\n\r\n* Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""\r\n* Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)\r\n* Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")\r\n\r\nThey're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\r\n\r\nTo my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.\r\n\r\nTo my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me.

I am FIRMLY against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.\n\nMany places in the US have only one available ISP, or one ""real"" choice for broadband internet. Regulating the ISP like a utility makes sense when there is no meaningful competition. If you truly want to promote innovation, then promote competition between ISPs by breaking up Comcast and Spectrum and allowing municipalities to create their own ISPs.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased competition: If everyone is on equal, neutral footing, competition is high. However, if a monopoly can leverage its size, it can prevent competition from every growing. This is happening with AT&T and Comcast sueing Google Fiber to prevent competition. Without Net Neutrality, Comcast and AT&T wouldn't even have to sue Google Fiber, they could threaten Google's business by slowing down Google services until Google does what they want. \n\n2. It prevents monopolies: If a Internet Service Provider (ISP) can control the speed of websites, they can degrade the performance of their competitors in order to A) Blackmail them for money, or B) Promote their own service. This happened in 2014 when Comcast throttled Netflix until Netflix paid Comcast for the same speeds everyone else was already getting.\n\n3. We can't currently vote with our wallets: In theory, Capitalism should sort this out, and consumers would choose with their wallets if they wanted Net Neutrality. The reality is that most people have 1 or 2 ISPs, max, that they can choose from. If neither are Net Neutral, consumers have no choice. \n\nWe need our politicians to stand in our best interests. If you get rid of Net Neutrality, ISPs will leverage their monopolies to hurt consumers, charging them more for fewer options. \n\nPlease KEEP Net Neutrality.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.\r\n\r\nTo my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination. \r\n\r\nI would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me. Please notify me of any opportunities to meet with you or your staff.\r\nJames Ryan Muratore","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The internet should adhere to our American tradition by leaving Internet Service Providers classified as a Title II common carrier service. The chairman's claim of lack of investment in broadband when ISPs are classified under Title II does not resonate with the reality of what capital expenditures were from 1996 - 2001. Furthermore, from 2002 -2012 CAPEX for broadband showed little to no growth while there were no enforceable Net Neutrality regulations on the FCC books. When Open Internet principles were codified in 2010/11 we saw a mild increase in CAPEX. However those were overruled in 2014. Looking at the history of Broadband CAPEX, history shows more broadband investment gains when ISPs are classified as Title II.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.\r\n\r\nTo my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.\r\n\r\nTo the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better.

Much of NH is rural and has limited access to broadband, but even in the populated areas of the state there is generally only one choice for broadband internet. In the largest city in the state, Manchester, the only ISP that can provide service with broadband speed (25mbps download) internet is Comcast.  It costs $75/month (before taxes and fees) for that 25mbps service. Fairpoint is able to provide 3mbps for $49, though that falls short of what the FCC considers ""Broadband"". ISPs are already taking advantage of consumers because they know they have no competition. If net neutrality is not preserved we, as consumers, will end up paying more money for worse service. And we can't take our business elsewhere because there's only one company that offers Broadband speed internet, and in many places NH Broadband isn't even available. \n\nAs an IT professional I urge the FCC to support Net Neutrality.

In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network.  I’m worried that the protections that are in place will be weakened if we change the way they’re enforced.

Internet service provides a necessity like any other utility: water, power, etc. Telecom’s ability to restrict web traffic and add fees onto already bloated bills would pose a hardship to our family, who use the internet for work and academic pursuits, as well as household needs. ISP’s restricting content while favoring theirs, and intrusion of privacy, pose the other serious concerns. This proposed change does anything but restore freedom for the public, as it would further limit advancement for many people. Nonprofits and startup corporations/businesses would suffer as well, thus inhibiting competition and in turn negatively affecting consumer choice and pricing. Our vital but struggling libraries and schools with their limited funding present more victims and we depend on them so much! To compete globally, all of our United States citizenry and its public services should have equal access to our version of the web. Communication tools benefit the good of our country, and such decisions should be weighed in that favor. Thank you for your time.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I find it repulsive that this initiative has been given the misleading title of, ""Restoring Internet Freedom For All Americans."" Net neutrality is what makes the internet free, in terms of universal access. Allowing corporations to force people to pay more to access premium websites creates devastating economic barriers, and thus makes the internet less free. The internet plays a crucial role in everyone's lives, and it is important that it remains accessible to all Americans, rich or poor. Ending net neutrality would increase costs for small businesses that draw customers with free wifi. These costs could easily make free wifi no longer feasible for such companies; their profits would see a decrease, or they could even go out of business, leaving countless employees without jobs. In private homes everywhere, families who can't afford a higher cost for premium websites may lose access to social media, through which they contact family and friends in other states. Students who can't afford premium internet sites could lose access to valuable research otherwise unavailable to them at their campus library. Sites that everyone uses in their daily lives, like YouTube, or Twitter, could only be available to the elite members of society. The beauty of the internet lies in its accessibility. It lies in the fact that small town musicians can make their music available to the whole world. It lies in the fact that film students can upload their creation, for free, to a site where their grandmother in another state can see it. It lies in the internet's ability to bring together families otherwise separated by oceans. The internet has granted Americans more freedom than they ever could have imagined thirty years ago. Countries that fear their people's freedom, like North Korea or China, place restrictions on their citizens' internet use. If the FCC allows corporations to place financial barriers and restrictions on the internet, our government is no better than those countries that treat freedom like a disease. The repeal of net neutrality only benefits the CEOs and executives that will line their pockets with the profits from helpless Americans. If you truly care for the freedom of all Americans, I implore you to keep net neutrality regulations in place.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman's plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Net neutrality is the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. I believe in this statement, and believe that equal access to equally-treated internet resources should be a right protected by the Federal government and the States. I do not support any policy-making or makers who would dismantle this right, either incrementally or wholly. \n\nAs an artist and a writer, who uses the internet daily to promote his work, the equitable and fair treatment of the pathways for information allow me to share my ideas and build an audience unobstructedly; net neutrality is central to the experience of the public good as well, who, rather than funneled and controlled, enjoy the same opportunity to come across my work--or ignore it--as they go about their lives online. This means my audience can be judged to enjoy my work, discuss it, comment on it, even reject it, without difficulty or distortion, and relatively equally and without the obstructionism of a self-interested institution or state. Culture can be said to decide this, not ideology. \n\nAs a citizen, I want to enjoy the same privilege to enjoy content, hate it, ignore it, or love it as I so choose.

I object strongly to this action. As I understand it, part of this decision is based upon claims that net neutrality cost 5 billion in broadband investment, yet this claim is based on a single study that the chairman cited by the Free State Foundation, which received funding from various telecom lobbying groups to perform the study ($375k from NCTA and $280k from CTIA between 2010 and 2014, just to name a couple). I am a scientific professional and keenly aware of the risks of making sweeping changes based upon faulty or single-point data, particularly data, as in this case, the acquisition of which has been funded by the very bodies which stand to profit the most from such changes. In scientific terms, we call that a ""conflict of interest"". Further, from a political standpoint, net neutrality, contradictory to what is being claimed, is vitally necessary to the free market, particularly to small businesses. To reiterate: I am strongly against the chairman's plan to reverse net neutrality and I believe that such a reversal will result in the loss of vital growth and innovation.","-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The need for classifying ISP’s as title II’s came about due to the same ISP’s increasing avarice for charging subscribers more in spite of already making record profits.  The large ISP’s of USA essentially want to have their cake and eat it too:  charge the subscribers an arm and a leg, charge third-party sites for ‘first class’ peering, and make little to no improvements on their infrastructure.  Fever pitch was reached a few years ago and former Chairman Wheeler’s decision to lead the way to ‘permanently’ cement the Open Internet as forever open should not be altered.\n\nDo not assume that revoking title II classifications will make ISP’s treat both customers and businesses fairly.  They won’t.\n\nAgain, the internet over the last two decades has been working fine.  However, regulation is now needed to ensure it stays that way.
