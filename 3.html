	<h2><span class="date">16 OCT 2020 | A Lack of Debate</span></h2>
	<p> Balanced "science" quotes from our presidential candidates:
	</p>
	<p> Trump&mdash;And its rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming,
		and we have the therapies coming.
		And I'll tell you what, one thing. When I got it, I had a choice.
		Do nothing, or use some of the things that we're looking at,
		like in this case, Regeneron...And I think that maybe I wouldn't be doing
		this discussion with you right now.
		We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure,
		but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah. [not Joe]
	</p>
	<p> Biden&mdash;I managed the Recovery Act and I was able to invest billions
		of dollars into bringing down the cost of the cost per
		british thermal unit of wind and solar...
	</p>
	<p> So we're making significant progress.
		The other thing we're going to do is provide
		an awful lot of work...because we'll save tons and tons of energy
		or billions of barrels of energy over time
		and at the same time provide significant employment and at good union wages,
		prevailing wages.

		It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained,
