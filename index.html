<a href="#">Pros and Cons of: Navy Life</a>
</h2>
<p>
One of the things I am most greatful to the Navy for is the simplifications
it has made to my daily life and other Quality of Life improvements.
So here are the PROS OF NAVY LIFE:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
NO NEED TO THINK ABOUT TEXT FORMATTING. ALWAYS USE MONOSPACED FONTS WITH
SUBSCRIPTS AND SUPERSCRIPTS OF VARYING WIDTH FOR READABILITY AND ALL CAPITALS
LETTERS ARE GOOD AND SENTANCES.
	</li>
	<li>
Logic systems are simplified by redefining the right implication
arrow (&#8658;) to mean <i>equivalent to, but in the STBD direction, and
without regard to the <a href="./Time-Survey/index.html">arrow of time</a></i>.
This allows you to do lots.
For example it becomes possible to prove, analytically, that
	<ul>
		<li>Death &#8658; Poor Safety.</li>
		<li>Result of input A due to negative feedback loop &#8658;
			input A to negative feedback loop.</li>
		<li>Proposition X &#8658; All hail Admiral Rickover Lets Learn About Neutrons!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
Learning highly classified methods for problem solving, including the
<i>Guess and Check</i> method.
	</li>
	<li>
Another method for decision making, is the
<i>``Because we're not Communists.''</i> motivating
method. Should I clean my room tonight? No&mdash;I mean, we're not communists!
	</li>
	<li>
The Navy officially reaffirmed my previous suspicion that
hexagons have six sides, that octagons cover your head, and that Pentagons
manage 5 branches, depending on how independent you consider the Coast Guard
and Marine Corps.
	</li>
	<li>Have to many forces in your life? You can use a force-taker
		to take forces, one of the many difficult to remember
		services available to service members. But can the force-taker
        be compelled to reveal confidential communications?
	</li>
</ol>
<p>But enough rantbling and onto the CONS OF NAVY LIFE:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		"Ribs" every thursday.
	</li>
	<li>
		Having to learn a new dictionary of terms, including:
		<ul><li>
		Excellence: <i>a quantitative quality measured by how much
			time you spend in the Rickover.</i>
		</li><li>
		Integrity: <i>a quantitative quality measured by how much time
			you spend in the Rickover.</i>
		</li><li>
		Knowledge: <i>I can't remember this one actually.</i>
		</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Playing king of the sonar dome when brown tank is discharged.
	</li>
	<li>Being the sacrificial Junior Officer during bilge maintenance.
	</li>
	<li>When Navy logic system doesn't help you decide what to do
		when attacked by a polar bear.

The coffee mug Joe got my Mom packs in a lot of thrust for your day!
I don't have the modeling software needed to make a meme as ridiculous

Programming Languages Are Confusing
</h2>
<p> Without knowing Haskell or really abstract mathematics, I don't
understand the point of "Monads". But for a lazy curious laymen,
the second answer on this stackoverflow page is helpful:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3870088/a-monad-is-just-a-monoid-in-the-category-of-endofunctors-whats-the-problem">
A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?
