<a href="Time-Survey/index.html">Pros and Cons of: Navy Life</a>
</h2>
<p>
One of the things I am most greatful to the Navy for is the simplifications
it has made to my daily life and other Quality of Life improvements.
So here are the PROS OF NAVY LIFE:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
NO NEED TO THINK ABOUT TEXT FORMATTING. ALWAYS USE MONOSPACED FONTS WITH
SUBSCRIPTS AND SUPERSCRIPTS OF VARYING WIDTH FOR READABILITY AND ALL CAPITALS
LETTERS ARE GOOD AND SENTANCES.
	</li>
	<li>
Most people spend their whole lives breathing standard atmospheric air (or even
worse&mdash;mile-high Colorado air) all with the depressing volumetric composition
78.09% Nitrogen, 20.95% Oxygen, 0.93% Argon,...etc. But at 650++ ft below the
sea the air is far richer, with over 101% net composition. And that's a fact.
	</li>
	<li>
Logic systems are simplified by redefining the double right implication
arrow (&#8658;) to mean <i>equivalent to, but in the STBD direction, and
without regard to the arrow of time</i>. This allows you to do lots.
For example it becomes possible to prove, analytically, that 
	<ul>
		<li>Steaming flank speed into an underwater mountain
			&#8658; Leadership problems</li>
		<li>Death &#8658; Poor Safety.</li>
		<li>Result of input due to negative feedback loop &#8658;
			input to negative feedback loop.</li>
		<li>Proposition X &#8658; All hail Admiral Rickover Lets Learn About Nuetrons!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
Learning extremely classified methods for clean decision making, including the
<i>Guess and Check</i> method.
	</li>
	<li>
Another method for decision making, most famously used to decide
<ul><li>
whether we should use heavy lead shielding or lead coolants in our reactors,
</li><li>
whether we should create a crisis by putting nuclear warheads on submergable,
undetectable boats xor on shifty, difficult to locate islands,
</li><li>whether we should use binary or ternary computers, and even 
</li><li>whether we should invade a landlocked country in the
middle of Asia
</li></ul>is the <i>``Because we're not Communists.''</i> motivating
method. Should I clean my room tonight? No&mdash;I mean, we're not communists!
	</li>
	<li>
The Navy officially reaffirmed my previous suspicion that
hexagons have six sides, that octagons cover your head, and that Pentagons
manage 5 branches, depending on how independent you consider the Coast Guard
and Marine Corps.
	</li>
	<li>Have to many forces in your life? You can use a force-taker
		to take forces, one of the many difficult to remember
		services available to service members. But don't tell me
		about it if you dont want me to tell.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>But enough rantbling and onto the CONS OF NAVY LIFE:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		"Ribs" every thursday.
	</li>
	<li>
		Having to learn a new dictionary of terms, including:
		<ul><li>
		Excellence: <i>a quantitative quality measured by how much 
			time you spend in the Rickover.</i>
		</li><li>
		Integrity: <i>a quantitative quality measured by how much time
			you spend in the Rickover.</i>
		</li><li>
		FCEONRASW130OB: <i>Future Competance at engineering and
			operating a nuclear reactor at sea with 130 sailors on 
			board&mdash;a qualitative value measured by how much 
			time you spend in the Rickover.</i>
		</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Using the head while brown tank is being discharged with
		[&geq; discharge depth pressurized air].
	</li>
	<li>Cross connecting san. tanks while brown tank is being discharged
		with [&geq; discharge depth pressurized air].
	</li>
	<li>Playing king of the sonar dome when brown tank is being discharged
		with [&geq; discharge depth pressurized air].
	</li>
	<li>Being the sacrificial Junior Officer during san. tank or bilge
		maintenance.
	</li>
	<li>When Navy logic system doesn't help you decide what to do
		when attacked by a polar bear.

For all you heavy space, car and coffee aficionados...

<p>
The coffee mug Joe got my Mom packs in a lot of thrust for your day!
I don't have the modeling software needed to make a meme as ridiculous
as this video though:

Programming Languages Are Confusing
</h2>
<p> Without knowing Haskell or really abstract mathematics, I don't
understand the point of "Monads". But for a lazy curious laymen,
the second answer on this stackoverflow page is helpful:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3870088/a-monad-is-just-a-monoid-in-the-category-of-endofunctors-whats-the-problem">
A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?
