	<h2><span class="date">16 OCT 2020 | A Lack of Debate</span></h2>
	<p> Our civilization's <em>long tradition of debate</em> makes clear which
		is <em>the party of science</em>:
	</p>
	<p> Trump&mdash;And its rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming,
		and we have the therapies coming.
		And I'll tell you what, one thing. When I got it, I had a choice.
		Do nothing, or use some of the things that we're looking at,
		like in this case, <em>Regeneron...And I think that maybe I wouldn't be doing
		this discussion with you right now.</em>
		We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure,
		but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah. [not Joe]
	</p>
	<p> Biden&mdash;I managed the Recovery Act and I was able to invest billions
		of dollars into bringing down the cost of the cost per
		<em>british thermal unit</em> of wind and solar...
	</p>
	<p> So we're making significant progress.
		The other thing we're going to do is provide
		<em>an awful lot of work</em>...because we'll save tons and tons of energy
		or <em>billions of barrels of energy</em> over time
		and at the same time provide significant employment and at good union wages,
		prevailing wages.

<a href="#">Pros and Cons of: Navy Life</a>
</h2>
<p>
One of the things I am most greatful to the Navy for is the simplifications
it has made to my daily life and other Quality of Life improvements.
So here are the PROS OF NAVY LIFE:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
NO NEED TO THINK ABOUT TEXT FORMATTING. ALWAYS USE MONOSPACED FONTS WITH
SUBSCRIPTS AND SUPERSCRIPTS OF VARYING WIDTH FOR READABILITY AND ALL CAPITALS
LETTERS ARE GOOD AND SENTANCES.
	</li>
	<li>
Logic systems are classicalish, with the right implication
arrow (&#8658;) meaning <i>equivalent to, but in the STBD direction and ignoring
contradictions.</i> This allows you to do lots.
For example it becomes possible to prove that
	<ul>
		<li>Death &#8658; Poor Safety.</li>
		<li>Result of input A due to negative feedback loop &#8658; result
			causes input A</li>
		<li>Proposition X &#8658; All hail Admiral Rickover lets learn about neutrons!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
Learning highly classified methods for problem solving, including the
<i>Guess and Check</i> method.
	</li>
	<li>
Another method for decision making, is the
<i>``Because we're not Communists.''</i> motivating
method. Should I clean my room tonight? No&mdash;I mean, we're not communists!
	</li>
	<li>
The Navy officially reaffirms my previous suspicion that
hexagons have six sides, that octagons cover your head, and that Pentagons
manage 5 branches, depending on how independent you consider the Coast Guard
and Marine Corps.
	</li>
	<li>Getting to work with the very advanced US naval <em>water brake</em>
		technology, the most efficiently inefficient system in the world and
		indeed in naval history.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>But enough rantbling and onto the CONS OF NAVY LIFE:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		"Ribs" every thursday.
	</li>
	<li>
		Having to learn a new dictionary of terms, including:
		<ul><li>
		Excellence: <i>a quantitative quality measured by how much
			time you spend in the Rickover.</i>
		</li><li>
		Integrity: <i>a quantitative quality measured by how much time
			you spend in the Rickover.</i>
		</li><li>
		Knowledge: <i>A qualitative quantity with value 2.5</i>
		</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Playing king of the sonar dome when brown tank is discharged.
	</li>
	<li>Being the sacrificial Junior Officer during bilge maintenance.
	</li>
	<li>When Navy logic system doesn't help you decide what to do
		when attacked by a polar bear.
