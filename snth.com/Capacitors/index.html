<h1 id="top">Selecting Capacitors for your PCB</h1>
<p>If you search digikey.com for capacitor, there are over 300,000 matches.
Even if you search for a specific capacitance (in fact, this article assumes
you are searching for a specific value for a PCB), say 10 pF, there are over 80,000
choices. How do you choose?</p>
<p>First, you must understand about the different types of capacitors
and their common uses. Second, you must understand how caps are labeled.
Finally, you can understand physical dimensions and which capacities are
available in each physical package.</p>

<h2 id="varieties">Varieties of Capacitors</h2>
<p><em>Ceramic capacitors</em> are a sandwich of conductor sheets, alternated
with layers of ceramic insulator material. The permitivity of
ceramic materials is highly controllable and layer thicknesses are
relatively large, so manufacturers can control the capacitance value easily.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ceramic caps typically small capacity (picoFarads - nanoFarads)</li>
	<li>Ceramic caps have no polarity</li>
	<li>Ceramic caps can survive high maximum voltages</li>
	<li>Ceramic caps usually have low loss</li>
	<li>Ceramic caps have stable capacitance over time, use, and temperature</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Electrolytic capacitors</em> use Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) for the
dielectric. Two long sheets of aluminum foil are seperated by a sheet of capacitor
paper and rolled into a cylinder. The surface of the aluminum foil reacts 
to produce a thin aluminum oxide layer. 
The aluminum oxide is a good forward-insulator when it is in contact with
electrolyte, but it can conduct easily in the other direction.
One side of the capacitor paper is inpregnated with eletrolyte to create the
insulation effect, giving electrolytic capacitors a forward-voltage polarity.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Electrolytic caps have high capacity (microFarads)</li>
	<li>Electrolytic caps have polarity; apply voltage the wrong direction and they will breakdown</li>
	<li>Electrolytic caps have low maximum voltages; they will breakdown.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tantalum capacitors</em> are similar to electrolytic capacitors except they use
the rare-earth metal tantalum instead of Aluminum. They are basically high end electrolytic
capacitors.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tantalum caps are used in similar places as electrolytic caps</li>
	<li>Tantalum caps have polarity</li>
</ul>

<p>You can usually tell from your schematic which type of capacitor is required because
polar capacitors have a different symbol. Polar caps are symbolized with a straight 
plate and a curved plate. Non-polar caps are sybolized by two symmetric, parallel plates.
Non-polar capacitors generally means a ceramic capacitor.
<p>Electrolytic or Tantalum capacitors are usually used for decoupling near the power
source. It is common to place a large electrolytic capacitor on either side of a voltage
regulator on a PCB. Decoupling means shunting noise in the power supply; the inductance
of a capacitor decreases as frequency increases, so they can be used as a short to ground
for noise (which is high frequency). Larger capacities are used for decoupling
near the power supply because<ol><li>the power supply sees larger currents than individual
ICs on the circuit, and</li><li>the noise from the power supply is a lower frequency (60 Hz
from the power grid), corresponding to a higher-cap filter.</li></ol></p>

<h2 id="codes">Capacitor Codes</h2>
<img src="capacitor-codes.JPG" alt="Capacitor Code Breakdown" width="502px"/>
<p>Larger capacitors will usually have their capacitance printed on the part, followed
by the units, such as 47uF. Smaller capacitors may not have as much space for text, so
they make use of capacitor codes. The codes have three digits and sometimes a letter.
The first two digits are the significant digits and the third digit is the power-of-ten
multiplier. The optional letter describes the tolerance %.</p>

<h2 id="digikey">Digikey Ordering Information</h2>
<p>These are the capacitors I am using on my current circuit board, Deja-view.
I try to order from Johansen Dielectrics because, as far as I can tell,
it is the only American supplier on Digikey. Updated on 05/14/14.</p>
