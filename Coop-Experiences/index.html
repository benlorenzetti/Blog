<h2 id="ttc">1. Toyota Technical Center</h2>
<p>I got to work at TTC in Ann Arbor Michigan for two semesters in 2012.
Originally Toyota was in Ann Arbor for EPA emissions testing, but the
office is much larger than that now. My department was Materials
Research Dept., and that very well describes what they did.
Everyone had a PhD in physics, chemistry, or other
science and across the way from the open office cubicals were wet
chemistry labs and electronics labs.
My job was to help one of the scientists, Mike Rowe,
run experiments and collect data on magnetic nanocomposites.
I also had other tasks like keeping the laboratory stocked,
cleaning, staying with vendors within the facility
(partly for politeness, partly IP concerns), writing an equipment
operating manual, and writing/presenting my experimental results.
</p>
<h3>Technical Takeaway</h3>
<p>This was an incredibly cool co-op and it was my first encounter
with real chemistry labs and nanomaterials.
I learned that everything is different at the nanometer scale and there
was a whole world of materials research at the heart of improving energy
efficiency for cars.
Materials for lithium battery anodes, magnetic nanoparticles
for transformer cores, carbon nanotube hybrids for heat dissipation,
paint that gives the appearance of contours where there are none, etc.
For existing technologies like ICEs, using new materials is one of the
few areas where efficiency gains can still be had.
</p>
<h3>Non-technical Takeaway</h3>
<p>
This was my first real intercultural experience. Although UC is
very diverse in general, my program was much like my hometown, which
makes sense for a state university. However at TTC, my cooworkers were
predominently Japanese, Chinese, and Indian and there were some differences.
A lot more people smoked. Hipsacks were
popular and walk-running in socks at the office was acceptable.
The biggest things were the way people showed agreement and disagreement
and socializing with your coworkers outside of the office.
I think in modern American culture most people draw a clear
distinction between work collegues and personal friends,
and it was nice to see that this isn't the default everywhere.
</p>
<p>I also learned a little more about the definition of diversity.
Ann Arbor is incredible ethnically diverse, but it is not actually very
diverse, in the sense that if you want to live there and can afford it,
you are most likely an academic at the University or work at one of the
highly technological employers nearby. The people are actually very
similar when it comes to lifestyle and the town reflects that.
Its clean, has beautiful parks, a million small restaurants, multimodal
transportation, lots of entertainment, grocery stores which cater
to health nuts and have foreign food sections, coffee shops,
and the average age of the people looks younger.

<h2 id="bmsl">2. BioMicroSystems Lab at UC</h2>
<p>BMS Lab was directed by Professor Ian Papautsky and focused on
microfluidics and biomedical application of electrical engineering.
I worked with a graduate student, Wenjing Kang, to help accelerate
1 of the 3 goals of her research: building a prototype device to
demonstrate her electrochemical sensors. You can read more about
Wenjing's work in
<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac502882s">Analytical Chemistry</a>.
Basically she was developing a process for measuring heavy metal
concentrations in water and blood, based on the idea that different
metal ions can be precipitated from solution at different electric
potentials. I helped build the electronics and packaging
to support the sensors.
</p>
<h3>Technical Takeaway</h3>
<p>On this co-op I learned about electrochemical measurement
techniques, sharpened my CAD skills (including KiCad, Eagle,
and SolidWorks), and got some more programming expercience.
Since I worked on campus, I was also able to take two difficult
EECE courses, one each semester, and have more success in learning
because of having more time than when in a standard 16-18 credit hour
monstrosity.
</p>
<h3>Non-technical Takeaway</h3>
<p>One of my goals was to decide if I should pursue graduate school
after UC. I decided not to and here is why.
The graduate student community is relatively tight knit, everyone is from
far away and in a similar situation, people are smart and interesting,
and there is a lot of collaboration between groups, borrowing of
equipment, etc.
So I got to meet a lot of students from many lab groups and one thing
you here is gossip about the professors and their research.
As a grad student, you are pretty much tethered to a particular professor
from day one and who this is has a very outsized impact on your success
and general wellbeing. I saw this firsthand, and even though most
professors and research topics were good, I don't think its worth the
risk. I'd rather come back to academia as someone who is financially
establised, like in Europe before the industrial revolution.

<h2 id="PG">3. P&amp;G Duracell</h2>
<p>At Duracell I worked at the C&amp;D cell make plant, which does
everything from drawing the steel cans and compacting the cathodes
to sealing, cleaning, and labeling the final product. I got to work
on a variety of projects, more from the business point of view,
including working with vendors on installation of new robotic,
copalletizers, PLC replacements, and packaging technologies.
</p>
<h3>Technical Takeaway</h3>
<p>This was my first real factory floor type job, the bread and
butter of manufacturing. I got exposed to many business aspects
of manufacturing and experience writing scopes of work for
quotations, working with vendors, and organizing design reviews.
A major area of emphasis for electrical engineers that wouldn't
initially spring to mind is operator safety. Many projects and
much concern was spent at P&amp;G regarding safety around the
manufacturing lines.</p>
<h3>Not-technical Takeaway</h3>
<p>Working as an engineer at a manufacturing plant, you are more of
a consumer than a builder because most of the design of the equipment
is outsourced to engineeering firms, plus the all of the veteran
technicians are way faster than you at fixing anything that breaks.
Your job is more project management, bringing all the pieces together
and ensuring everything will work safely, together,
as intended before it is installed. This requires taking a step back
from the level of engineering I prefer and it especially
requires soft, people skills. I count this as a non-technical takaway
but it my primary takeaway from Duracell.
