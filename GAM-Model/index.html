<p> The dirty-bit secret of RAM has always been that it is implemented
as a hierarchy in hardware&mdash;implying memory access time is
logarithmic, not constant time for any distance.
As data sets grow and machines gain more parallel processors,
we need to take this more seriously in our analysis of algorithms.
Random access memory (RAM) is too cheap a mathematical model and 
I plan to start using a geometric model called <i>``Jam''</i> (GAM).
For example I analyze <span class="math1">buildheap()</span>
under this memory model and, out of laziness, prophesize that
comparison based sorting cannot overcome
<span class="math1">O(nlog n)</span> complexity, even
when marshaling a logarithmic number of processors.
</p>
<p> If we are going to make complexity analysis more...complex...,
we need to justify why. If the addressable memory of a 64-bit
computer is fixed at N=2^64 chars, why not just assert the access time
for any char is
<span style="math1">log(2^64) = 64 = (constant)</span>?
And if we forge ahead with a geometric model for memory,
where does the complexity stop? After all integer addition, a most
fundamental operation, is also logarithmic in N.
A similar debate exists regarding Scala's vectors, which you can read
about at Mr. Haoyi's blog: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/ScalaVectoroperationsarentEffectivelyConstanttime.html">
Scala Vector Operations Aren't ``Effectively Constant Time''</a>.
</p>
<p> I think we should err on the side of being more complete
in our analyses and consider both of these two fundamental
operations logarithmic. If software can be written with
these concepts in mind, hardware may be able to follow with
increasing speed.

<h2>1. Triangle Series and Geometric Series</h2>
<p> Before we get started describing the GAM model and
<span class="math1">buildheap()</span>, there are two series
that will be convenient to use, the venerable geometric series and 
the triangle series. The triangle series is like the factorial
function, but adding integer levels instead of multiplying integer
factors. There is also less to think about the
<i>``zeroth''</i> element.
</p>
<img src="./latex/triangle-series-open-form.png">
<p> We can derive a closed form for the
<span class="math1">&Delta;</span> series by
reversing the index scheme and comparing it to the original.</p>
<img src="./latex/triangle-series-closed-form-derivation.png">
<p> Finally we are left with
    <span class="math1">
        <img src="./latex/triangle-series-closed-form.png">
    </span>
.</p>
<p> It is helpful to have not just the infinte geometric series but
also its derivative with respect to <span class="math1">r</span>,
shifted left&mdash;and this done twice.

<h2>2. The GAM Model</h2>
<p> The geometric access memory model is based on the heirarchial
structure of hardware, adders, multiplexers, and demultiplexers, and
on partions of memory and integer value types. It says that
<em>memory access time is proportional, to position of the most
significant digit different from a reference address.</em>
I'm not being particularly original or creative here;
heirarchial memory models are discussed in plenty of literature.
[<a href="#note1">1</a>, <a href="#note2">2</a>]
One thing I think is surprising is the indexing direction you
need to use for multiplexing, the highest bits need to code the
smallest physical distances.
</p>

     alt="geometric-multiplexer-addressing.png">
<p> One can imagine adding shortcuts from memory cells into this MUX
to short circuit the gate depth logarithmically for smaller distances.
But it is unfortunate that determining the highest set bit in real
time is also a logarithmic operation. We would need a-priori
knowledge from software.
