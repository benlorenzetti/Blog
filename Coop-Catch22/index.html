<h1>The Co-op Catch-22</h1>
<p>The University of Cincinnati differentiates itself with a mandatory
co-op program, where students alternate each semester between
taking courses xor working full time in industry. An undergraduate
engineering degree is earned over five years instead of four.
</p>

<p>Personally, I have benefited tremendously from the co-op program
but for many others I doubt this is true, because of the strain it puts
on relationships and communities, and the opportunity cost of working as
a graduate in the 4+1 year.
</p>

<p>The often touted benefits of co-op, gain experience, boost your resume,
employment offer upon graduation, less school debt, breaks from school stress,
see new places, etc. are all true, but summed together they are may not be
worth the tradeoff.
</p>
<p>The single benfit that made it worth it for me&mdash;and I only recommend
co-op if this describes you too&mdash;is that I was wrong as a freshman about
what was interesting in the world and what I wanted to do.
Co-op prolonged my education and gave me financial leeway, both enough that
I could switch trajectories when I finally learned where I wanted to go.
</p>
<p>So are you wrong about what you want to do?</p>
