<h1>Sanctions w.r.t. Venezuela</h1>
<p> The US is imposing sactions on our financial entities, preventing them from
future business with Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela;
we accuse Maduro of stealing the vote and his government of
being idealogically opposed to US since his predecessor Hugo Chavez.
</p>
<p> There is some debate whether our sactions are too weak or too strong.
Some say sanctions should have been harsher, driving
up oil prices in the US but crippling the Maduro government overnight.
Some say we should do nothing and let Maduro's authoritarian socialist
government implode without any excuse of US post-imperialism.
But there is also a more unconvential path we could follow.
</p>
<p>
To keep his grip on power, Maduro needs more money than current oil revenue
can afford and we may expect US investors, who are currently about
60% of those invested in Maduro, especially Goldman Sachs,
to continue capitalizing Venezuela and other
resource cursed, socialish countries.
</p>
<p> If we believe in free capitalism more than socialism, and therefore think that Maduro
will eventually default and/or become a total dictator, perhaps a better course
is to preemptively call a default on all US investment in Venezuela.
Declare all those bonds junk overnight by some legal authority that lawyers
can argue about and then enforce, since US-international law is rule by law,
not rule of law.
</p>
<p> Suddenly the anti-imperialists will be forced to admit the facts do not
support their case and we can all start living in this century.
Commodity speculating capitalists will have to think twice before investing
in any government that rejects American values of freedom and democracy.
As a side benefit, the relative cost of
capitalizing American factories will fall.
</p>
<p> This would have to be an executive action; Goldman Sachs would never let
republicans or democrats in congress do such a thing. Perhap Trump,
who is famously hated by everyone and claimed to rich to be bought,
perhaps he is the right guy to make such a leadership call.
