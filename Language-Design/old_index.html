<h1>On Programming Languages</h1>

<p>Any language has two fundamental purposes: communication with others and
clarification of ones' own thoughts.
Unfortunately, these two do not always go hand in hand.</p>

<p>I think we should consider how much we value dissemination vs. distillation,
and evaluate the languages we use everyday. If you value communication 100% over distilling
thoughts in your head, then the network effect dominates and you should just go with the flow.
But if you have trouble expressing yourself, feel constantly bombarded by information,
or find yourself unmotivated to study vocab for the GRE,
then perhaps parts of our language are not optimal.
</p>

<p>Probably programmers are more inclined to think about languages, because language
choice affects what machines they can distribute to, how programs are organized,
how long programs take to write, and who they work with.
Your language choice even confers a sense of identity and community within the programmng world.
But this idea is for everbody, and every language. For example:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Would the ABC song be more fun if we had letters for the spanish R-trill or the clicks in Bantu languages?</li>
	<li>How long, when living abroad, do you have to speak a language before you dream in it?</li>
	<li>Is "imaginary" really the best translation for that dimension from math to English?</li>
	<li>Does your programming language effect your thought process?

	<li>Why are American students required to study foreign languages for 4+ years,
		when they already speak the most widely spoken language in terms of raw population,
		scientific publications, and business?</li>
	<li>Will the world eventually converge to a common tongue?</li>
	<li>Is High Valerian more similar to Elvish or Latin?</li>
	<li>Is it better to have a unified system of written and spoken word, or should
		text not be bounded by the limits of our vocal cords? (Like Kanji and Hiragana)</li>
	<li>Is a number system based on our fingers really the most optimal for describing quantities?</li>
	<li>Russian does not have any articles, do "a", "an" and "the" really add anything to English?</li>
	<li>Is French romantic or is Espan<emph>ol</emph> sexist?</li>
	<li>Why are so many Chinese names suggestive in English?</li>
	<li>Would Catalonia want independence if it weren't for Catalan?</li>
	<li>Is C the best programming language?</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't have the answers, but I hope you agree it is interesting.
The thing is, you don't have a lot of choice about what language you use in daily life.
Even if you did, I doubt there are significant differences between what you can express in
English, German, Hindu, or Chinese.
But neither is true of programming, where you can choose the languages you use and there certainly
are differences.
Hopefully this will be the first of many posts as I learn and compare new languages.

<h2>Features of C-- that differentiate it from C</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Object Oriented (state machines, memory management, inheritance, polymorphism, parallelism)</li>
	<li>new and delete (malloc and free would not be supported on all systems-so good they are part of std library not language itself)</li>
	<li>Function overloading</li>
	<li>Templates</li>
	<li>namespaces</li>
	<li>More complicated/more safe casting</li>
	<li>Booleans</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features that C++ added, relative to C</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Enumeration</li>
	<li>New types (as opposed to using typedef in C)</li>
	<li>Pass by reference</li>
	<li>String "types"</li>
	<li>STL</li>
</ol>

<p>Bjarne Stroustroup has a great many ideas, has added much to computer language,
and continues to do so. In fact, this comparison of C and C++ is almost certainly
incomplete because I am only at level C++11.
But I don't plan on learning any more C++; if you have limited time you eventually
must make decisions. C++ was always backwards compatible with C, and each subsequent
version of C++ continues backward compatibilty.
In English, if you strive for the longest sequence of backward compatibility,
you end up going from "desserts" to "stressed".</p>

<p>And that is what is wonderful about English, it only took a quick googling
(which is a verb) of "backward words" to correlate C with mint chocolate chip ice cream and C++ with stress.
</p>

<p>Of the three languages I've truely experienced, C is my favorite and the standard of
comparison for others in the future.
I've put aside C++, but I won't forget the features that I wish were incorporated
in standard C, namely obviating typedef, parameters by reference, (and a standard string?).
