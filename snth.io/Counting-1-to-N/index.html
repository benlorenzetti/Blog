<h1>Counting from 1 to N</h1>
<p>What is the <em>first</em> natural number? Well, when phrased this way
the answer is clearly 1. The Romans knew this, they didn't even have a
numeral for zero, instead using X for 10 and C, M for 100, 1000. 
[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]
Yet today most programming languages, and digital systems in general,
start their numbering at zero.</p>

<p>Edsger Dijkstra described this problem very well in his note
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD831.PDF" target="_blank">
"Why numbering should start at zero"</a>.
However I respectfully disagree with his conclusion, it is more natural
to define the set 
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&#8469;={1, 2, 3, 4,...}</span>
than to start counting at zero with 
<span style="white-space:nowrap;" >&#8469;={0, 1, 2, 3,...}.</span>
</p>

<p>Of course practically it doesn't matter--if you have 256 bytes
of memory available in RAM, you can uniquely address each location by
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">{0, 1, 2, ... , 254, 255}</span>
or <span style="white-space:nowrap;">{1, 2, 3, ... , 255, 256}</span>
equally easily because in binary 0 and 256 have the same representation
within 8-bits.
Zero, represented by <span class="code">00000000</span> is not discernable from 
<span class="code">(1)00000000</span>, which is Two Fifty Six.
</p>

<p>I think  that starting at 1 is better because if you have N
elements, then the index of the last elements tells you how many there are
and accessing the Nth memory location is not out-of-bounds.
However C starts counting at zero and always identifies larger 
blocks of data from the leftmost byte.
</p>
<p>To have a successful systems language use 1-to-N indexing,
you would need a computer architecture that addressed multibyte
words from the right, not the left.
So a 4-byte word would be pointed to by its 4th byte
and the new language could support type casting of different size structs
by preserving the location of the Nth byte, even as the value of N changes.
</p>

<p>32-bit words addressed from the left vs the right</p>

<p>A pragmatic advantage of a right vs left memory model is easy 
type casting for big-endian byte order,
which is the character/digit order English speakers read and write in.
It is also the byte order of the internet. (Easier to change a machine to the
network than a network to the machine.) 
</p>

alt="Big-endian byte order matches alphabetical order" width="500px"/>

<p>Big-endian ordering matches alphabetical order; with ASCII encoding,
"abc" indeed evaluates to a value less than "cba"</p>

<p>A right edge, or 1-to-N memory model would also remove the dissonance
between array and list indexing present in most languages and might
reduce memory access errors associated with location N.</p>

<p>But what about real world applications?
In digital signal processing time usually starts at zero, not one
(Much to the frustration of engineers using MATLAB).
</p>

<p>Exploring this further is one of my current projects, and so
far there are some potentially promising results.</p>

<p>The first is just cognitively nice: if you have N datapoints starting
at 1 (dimensionless) and take this to approximate a real time signal
with segments measured from the right, then doubling the
number of datapoints can take you twice further towards infinity or
close half the distance to zero.</p>

<p>Second, simple geometric series becomes sort-of invertible if you 
start at 1 and negate the result.
This also leads to a strange situation where
convolving with z^n from 0 to &#x221e; (i.e. the unilateral Z-transform)
produces the same result as correlating with z^n from 1 to &#x221e;
(Although the ROCs go in opposite directions).</p>

<p>If the last paragraph hardly made any sense, well it doesn't yet to
me either. But stay tuned for more!</p>

<footer id="footnote1">[1] This is a little bit cheeky, most would say
the Romans had not yet discoverd zero. 
The Romans had the word nulla to indicate the lack of any countable items,
but they did not have the concept of zero as a placeholder in a decimal number system. 
This was invented in India and it was not until the middle ages that 
"this precious knowledge of nothing"
made its way to Europe through Arab trade in Moorish Spain.
Fun fact, there is no year 0 BC or 0 AD.
