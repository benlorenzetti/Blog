<h1>Welcome Friends!</h1>

<p>Before we begin I'd like to apologize because, when it comes to electronic media, I have a proud tradition of poor introductions.</p>

<p>The first time this happened was my 8th birthday, when Mom and Dad and
my grandparents colluded to give me a Gameboy Color and Pokemon Red.
In a fit of creativity, I named my character Ben.
Even worse, my rival and starter were named "???" and "UNKNOWN" because I 
took the naming prompts very literally.

<p>Second, when we got to play laser tag, I always ended up with Alan Shepard
while my friends got Yoda, Captain Kirk, etc.
(which in the moment was awful but in retrospect awesome) 

<p>Somewhat later (UNKNOWN was definitely level 100) was a formative event
for any teenage boy--calling your girlfriend while everyone in the kitchen
drops eaves. To make matters worse, her parents were deaf and used a
voice-to-text telephony service provided by the great Buckeye state. 
I spoke to a grown man in Columbus and he was responsible for typing
what I said and reading her reply...in tone of the day.
There were also semantic control words to remember, such as "wait, hold on.  
No wait, please delete wait, hold on" and "OH GOODNESS DON'T TYPE THAT!"
Very embarrassing.
</p>

<p>Fourth in college, whenever I needed to write a "Hello World" program, 
I usually choose inquisitive or ambivalent punctuation
because I felt strongly that the exclamation mark was over used.
I definitely went overboard, and pointlessly so, with my 
<a href="">AVR hello world</a>.
</p>

<p>But now it is time for a good electronic introduction!
Hi, I'm Ben and welcome to myspace.
This is where I will share with you the thoughts on my mind and the goals I am working towards.
Here's what you need to know:</p>
<ol>
	<li>I'm an engineering student at the University of Cincinnati.
	I think it should be called engineering, not electrical engineering.</li>
	<li>I'm cutting-edge, because I texted via phone before people texted via phone (see above).</li>
	<li>I am on book 5 in <em>A Song of Fire and Ice</em>.
	If I ever write a feudal fantasy series, it will be titled <em>Sandarac</em>.</li>
	<li>One day, I hope to free the world from the limitations of current condiment dispensing technology.</li>
	<li>Dayton should really be generating hydroelectric power from its conservancy dams. What a waste.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope you enjoy my blog, or enjoy it and teach me when I'm wrong,
or enjoy it so much you start your own! [<a href="#note-2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>Smell ya later,<br/>Ben</p>

<p id="note-1">[<a href="#footnote-1">1</a>] Unfortunately, neither Pokemon nor life have a naming guru for people.</p>
<p id="note-2">[2] In fact, I really hope you start your own website and that it becomes easier to do so.
I am not on Facebook as a political statement for privacy, identity, and independence,
but it is kind of lonely not being able to follow my friends.
