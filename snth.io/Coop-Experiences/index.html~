<h1>Co-op Experiences</h1>
<h2>Toyota Technical Center</h2>
<p>I got to work at TTC in Ann Arbor Michigan for two semesters in 2012.
Originally Toyota was in Ann Arbor for EPA emissions testing, but the
office is much larger than that now. My department was Materials
Research Dept., and that very well describes what they did.
Everyone in the department had a PhD in physics, chemistry, or other
science and across the way from the open office cubicals were wet
chemistry labs and electronics labs.
My job was to help one of the scientists, Mike Rowe,
run experiments and collect data on magnetic nanocomposites.
I also had other tasks like keeping the laboratory stocked,
cleaning, staying with vendors within the facility
(partly for politeness, partly IP concerns), writing an equipment
operating manual, and writing/presenting my experimental results.
</p>
<h3>Technical Idea</h3>
<p>This was an incredibly cool co-op and it was my first encounter
with chemistry labs and nano materials.
I learned that everything is different at the nano scale and there
was a whole world of materials research at the heart of improving energy
efficiency for cars.
Materials for lithium battery anodes, magnetic nanoparticles
for transformer cores, carbon nanotube hybrids for heat dissipation,
paint that gives the appearance of contours where there are none, etc.

<h3>Non-technical Idea</h3>
