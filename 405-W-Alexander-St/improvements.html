<h2>Washer and Dryer</h2>
<p> I am a big fan of vertically stacked laundry and dryers, and no product
  epitomizes this like the GE Spacemaker. It was hard to get during Covid and
  the door to the laundry room and the existing cabinetry had to be removed
  to get it in, but ultimately this is going to reclaim space in this little
  1160 ft2 home.
</p>
<p> Most lame apartment complexes nickel and dime you with an
  extra charge for washer and dryer, usually $50/month
  (a lot, ...I'll Grant you).
  Although St Marys has a nearby laundromat (conveniently located next to a
  bar), this investment should add value to the home at least equal to itself
  if there are no major maintenance issues for 3 years.

<h2>Attic Access</h2>
<p> The attic was gross with old junk, worn paper and crumbling cardboard,
  ripe for bugs. It is hard to get around on the rafters due to the low pitch
  of the roof. Perhaps this is why the living room ceiling fan was so
  precariously mounted, held in place solely by rusting 1/16" wire wrapped
  around an ascanse 2x6.
</p>
<p> The attic looks much better with all of the trash removed and a few
  extra studs and mixed 1/2 and 3/4" plywood installed for easier access to
  the central utilities despite the low pitch. I am happy to have found the
  lighting fixture deficiency before it found me, hopefully there are no
  other problems going unnoticed. On account of the lighting fixture alone,
  I consider the attic access improvement a good investment.
