<h1>Should I Buy or Rent?</h1>
<p> Buying a home is a big deal and finding a competitive price could save you
	months of pay at work.
	This series uses example values from my own first home purchase.
</p>
<p> The themes are simple. Think like a landlord and tenant,
	not like a homeowner. Understand the property price model. Do the work
	to accurately estimate inputs but use tools to make comparing offers easier.
</p>

	<li>Property Price Model</li>
	<li>Tackling the Vat of Constants</li>
	<li>Set Aside Money Like a Landlord</li>
	<li>Its Real Estate</li>
</ol>
<p> The first article provides a simple, clean mortgage calculator,
	both as a ready-use tool and to introduce concepts used in the property
	price model.
</p>
<p> [not published] Second introduces the property price model and provides a calculator
	for repeated use once its constants are determined. Selling prices below
	the model's output are either a very good deal or an indication of economic
	turmoil or population decline. The effect of interest rates and
	inflation are shown to add credibility to the model.
</p>
<p> [not published] Third determines the constants related to government policies, which
	are publically available and is only required once for all the deal
	comparisons in an area. It segues into the fourth with land value
  assessment.
</p>
<p> [not published] Fourth dives into estimating all the expenses of being a landlord.
	It is where the most uncertainty was for me as a first time buyer and
	you will have to do the work of adjusting it to your locale. However,
	many of the constants, once calculated, can be used repeatedly for local
	comparisons.
