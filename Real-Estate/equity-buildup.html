<h1>Equity Buildup</h1>
<h2>Sep. 2021</h2>
<p> The <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">mortgage calculator</a>
  proved that mortgage principal and monthly payments (p) are
  related by an independent constant, set by interest rates (r)
	and loan period (N).
  The next <a href="index.html">three articles</a> used this
  to build a relationship between home prices and rent, but
  did not account for a major difference between borrowing and
  renting&mdash;building up equity in a home.
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-summary.png">
<p> Similarly, the results show the rate of nominal equity buildup
	(&Delta;En) is independent of the price tag and can be applied
	equivalently to any sized mortgage (&Proportional;p). The second significant
	result is the impact of inflation on the gains from the
	loan liability, making equity buildup much more biased towards
	a straight line that the exponential curve typically associated
	with mortgages due to paying off a growing portion of principal
	each month.
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup.png" width="100%">
<p> Unlike <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/">
	inferior mortgage calculators</a> with admittedly pretty,
  quasi-exponential interactive graphics, this site's calculator
	and articles emphasize the linear aspects of mortgages in
	the 21st Century. The
	<a href="leverage-ratio.html">next article</a> continues down
	this path by defining the leverage ratio and also accounting
	for closing costs, which are not included in the proof below.
</p>
<h2>Equity Buildup Proof</h2>
<p> The equity gained each month is due to the amount of principal
  repayed (i.e. difference between principal remaining
  between month m and m+1) and due to exposure to
  inflation/deflation of the remaining liability.
</p>
<img src="single-month-equity.png">
<p> Equity buildup uses the same mortgage equations proved for the
  <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">mortgage calculator</a>,
  except the loan period 'N' is replaced by a number of 'm' months
  owned. 'P0' is initial loan principal, 'p' the monthly payment,
  and 'r' the monthly interest multiplication factor.
</p>
<img src="mortgage-decay.png">
<p> The sum of nominal gains over n months '&Delta;En':
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-proof.png">
<p> All that remains is slight rearrangement for aesthetics
	and description. This equation describes equity buildup of
	the loan liability itself, the
	<a href="leverage-ratio.html">next article</a> accounts for closing
	costs and financing fees which are not included in this equation.
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-summary.png">
<p> One degenerate result is if inflation was zero, the final
  value reached over the loan period is equal to Rm, but one
	interesting results is that this equation devolves into a straight
	line if inflation rates equal interest rates. This will be
	explored further later in this <a href="index.html">series</a>.
