<h1>Leverage Ratio</h1>
<h2>Aug. 2021</h2>
<p> For a landlord, both monthly cash flow and rate of
	equity buildup depended on the leverage gained with a mortgage
	(i.e. down payment) and inflation relative to this leverage.
	Later we will analyze how the <a href="refinance-window.html">
	timeframe of the mortgage before refinancing or sale</a> also
	affects the rate of equity buildup.
</p>
<p> The effective leverage ratio (L) for a property of value (V) is the
	ratio of loan size (V-E0) to the down payment plus closing costs and
	financing fees (E0+F). It is always a	rational number greater than or
	equal to zero. For conveniance, we also define a proper fraction f
	based on closing fees and several other rearrangements.
</p>
<img src="leverage-ratio.png">
<p> The inflation-adjusted, monthly yield of a property is due to net
	income from rent after expenses (q), less the inflation-adjusted
	mortgage payment (p), and due to inflation-adjusted
	<a href="equity-buildup.html">equity buildup</a> (&Sigma;n) over a period
	of n months.
</p>
<img src="adjusted-yield-start.png">
<p> Both portions of the monthly yield depend strongly on the
	effective leverage ratio.
  In the past, the leverage ratio would be constrained by
  federal reserve requirements and other government policies.
	Today the effective leverage ratio is constrained by funding
	fees and quasi-federal/private policies/regulations.
	With a strong history of constraints but evolving loan
	standards, it is desirable to express the inflation-adjusted
	yield in terms of the leverage ratio.
</p>
<p> From the <a href="index.html">previous articles in
  this series</a>, the monthly mortgage payment (p) and loan
	principal (property price, V, minus down payment, E0) are related
	by a constant R(N) that is set by mortgage rates.
</p>
<img src="leverage-payments-ratio.png">
<p> Rewriting the inflation-adjusted yield in these terms:</p>
<img src="lingering-p-yield.png">
<p> The <a href="marginal-dividend.html">marginal dividend model</a>
	is based on a price point q&times;R(N) where every dollar paid down earns the
	monthly marginal dividend rate 1/R(N). However the sales prices
	could be at a premium or discount to this price point, represented
	by a scalar c. Using this premium allows to express the monthly cash
	flow ratio (q/p) in terms of the leverage ratio (i.e. down payment).
</p>
<img src="cash-flow-ratio.png">
<p> The optimum effective leverage ratio (L0) can be found
based on the likely timeframe (n months) before selling or
refinancing:
</p>
<img src="leverage-optimum.png">
<p> Finally, for sufficiently large n the optimum can be approximated.
	From the last article, if inflation equals interest rates, then
	<span style="white-space:nowrap;">n &gt;&gt; 2&times;f&times;Rm</span>.
</p>
<img src="leverage-approximation.png">
<p> Considering typical values for Rm and f (Rm&gt;200 and f&lt;0.1) and
	a typical down payment of 20% (L &approx; 4), it is fairly safe to
	assume that the optimum leverage ratio is simply the lowest costs to
	close you are offered without significant additional fees.
</p>
<p> To summarize, the yield equation combining both monthly cash
	flow and equity buildup is useful to express in terms of the leverage
	ratio and the optimum leverage ratio is the maximum permitted
	by lending standards and your own solvency. Next is determining
	how the <a href="refinance-window.html">time of ownership or
	refinancing</a> affects the yield from building up equity.
