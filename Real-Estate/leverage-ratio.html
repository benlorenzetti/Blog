<h1>Leverage Ratio</h1>
<h2>Aug. 2021</h2>
<p> For a landlord, both monthly cash flow and rate of
	equity buildup depended on their initial down payment,
	or their leverage gained with a mortgage. Later we will
	determine how the <a href="refinancing.html">timeframe
	of the mortgage</a> before refinancing or sale also
	affects the rate of equity buildup.
</p>
<p> The net monthly yield of a property is due to net income from
  rent after expenses, less the mortgage payment (p), and due to
  <a href="equity-buildup.html">equity buildup</a>
  (&Delta;En) over a period of n months from mortgage payments and
  appreciation.
</p>
<img src="combined-yield-start.png">
<p> The effective leverage ratio (L) is the ratio of loan size
	(P-E0) to down payment plus closing/financing fees (E0+F).
	It is always a	rational number greater than or equal to zero.
	For conveniance, we also define two proper fractions e and f
	based on closing costs such that e+f=1.
</p>
<img src="leverage-ratio.png">
<p> The <a href="marginal-dividend.html">marginal
  dividend model</a> calculates a target size for home
	loans, based on a break even point where monthly mortgage payments
	equal the net income for rental properties after other expenses.
	From the <a href="index.html">previous articles in
  this series</a>, the monthly mortgage payment (p) and loan
	principal (property price, P, minus down payment, E0) are related
	by a constant (Rm) that is set by mortgage rates.
</p>
<img src="marginal-model-eqs.png">
<p> Both of these portions depend strongly on the
	effective leverage ratio.
  In the past, the leverage ratio would be constrained by
  federal reserve requirements. Today the effective leverage ratio
	is only constrained by funding fees and quasi-federal/private
	bank policies, so it is important to determine the effect of
	leverage on yield.
</p>
<img src="combined-yield.png">
<p> The optimum effective leverage ratio (L0) can be found
based on the likely timeframe (n months) before selling or
refinancing:

<p> Finally, for <span style="white-space:nowrap;">n &gt; C</span>
  the optimum can be approximated:</p>
