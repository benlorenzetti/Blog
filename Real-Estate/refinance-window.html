<h1>When Should I Sell or Refinance?</h1>
<p> This is the seventh part of a series <a href="index.html">Should
	I Buy or Rent?</a>
</p>
<p> As a powerful argument on the nature of fiat currency, as
	<a href="https://voxeu.org/article/towards-global-narrative-long-term-real-interest-rates">
	real interest rates trend toward zero</a>,
	the optimum period for owning a mortgage liability becomes approximatable
	analytically! But, without getting sidetracked into economic debate, the
	goal here is find the peak yield for owning a property and mortgage.
</p>
<img src="combined-yield-summary.png">
<p> The inflation (i) adjusted yield depends on the
	<a href="leverage-ratio.html">leverage ratio</a> (L) and the
	<a href="equity-buildup.html">equity buildup</a> &Sigma;(n)/p,
	and these equation and all the other terms are defined in
	those articles. For here, the combined yield (Y) is composed of two parts,
	the cash flow dividend (X) made each month and an ammortized dividend from
	equity buildup (y)-1 when you sell or refinance.
	These two parts are demonstrated in the graph below.
</p>
<img src="cash-flow-peak-shift.png" width=75%>

<p> To help determine an approximate time for peak yields, there are
	three assumptions we will use.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Inflation and interest rates are nearly equal.</li>
	<li>Inflation is low enough a first order approximation of the natural log
		holds.</li>
	<li>The leverage ratio is sufficiently large and external yield (X)
		sufficiently flat that the peak net yield (Y) occurs nearly concurrently
		with equity yield (y).
	</li>
</ol>
<h2>Maximizing Equity Yield</h2>
<p> The rate of equity buildup, in inflation back-adjusted terms is:
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-summary.png">
<p> If we assume real interest rates are zero, or that inflation equals
	the nominal interest rate <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(i = r)</span>,
	then equity buildup becomes linear and the first intersection point of an
	"refinance window" can be found quadratically.
	This optimum "window" represents the tangent point for capital gains from
	equity buildup (blue), equivalently compared to regular dividends from stocks
	or rental cash flow (dotted black).
</p>
<img src="refinance-window.png" width="75%">
<h2>Optimum Point Derivation</h2>
<p> To make the algebra easier, we define some helper variables and then
	take the derivative of the equity yield (y) to find its optimum.
</p>
<img src="y-derivative.png">
<p> Setting the derivative equal to zero, substituting n for &Sigma;n/p, and
	assuming g is near 1 to approximate
	<span style="white-space:nowrap;">ln(g) = g - 1</span>
	results in a quadratic equation we can solve.
</p>
<img src="quadratic-point.png">
<p> The long tangent of the last three articles was to reach this
	point. Now the <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">mortgage calculator
	</a> can estimate yields from the loan liability for comparisons to
	stocks or other investments!
