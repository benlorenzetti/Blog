<h1>Inflation Dilation</h1>
<h2>Aug. 2021</h2>
<p> The <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">mortgage calculator</a>
  proved that mortgage principal and monthly payments are
  related by a constant, fixed by monthly interest rate
  and loan period.
  The next <a href="index.html">three articles</a> used this
  to build a relationship between mortgage sizes and rent, but
  did not account for a major difference between borrowing and
  renting&mdash;building up equity in a home.
	The next goal is to compare a
	<a href="#">home price-to-earnings ratio</a>
	to other investments.
</p>
<p> An optimum equivalent dividend yield can be computed
	(unfortunately not analytically solved) based on mortgage
	and inflation rates, and MATLAB/Octave functions for this are included
	below. The most interesting results are that this dividend yield
	comes from owning the loan liability, not the actual down payment
	invested, and also the effects of inflation on this yield through
	price appreciation and refinancing costs.
</p>
<img src="liability-dividend-yield.png" width="75%">
<p> For example, refinancing a 2%, 30-year, fixed rate mortgage at
	the optimum time could earn a 0.75% annualized return if
	refinancing cost one year's worth of mortgage payments and home
	prices appreciated at a 1-2% rate.
	Further, if the mortgage was 4x the intial down payment,
	then the annualized capital gain could be 4&times;0.75% (3%).
</p>
<h2>How These Results were Derived</h2>
<p> The equity gained each month is due to the amount
  of principal repayed (i.e. difference between principal remaining
  between month m and m+1) and due to exposure to
  inflation/deflation of the remaining liability.
</p>
<img src="single-month-equity.png">
<p> Summing these monthly gains over 'n' months shows how inflation
  affects the profitability of selling your home or the safety net you
  build up if you ever need to refinance (less a transaction cost 'C').
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-final.png">
<p> The proof is appended below, where 'r' and 'inf' are monthly
  interest and inflation multiplication factors, 'p' is monthly
  payment, and 'N' is mortgage period 360 months.
	The effect of refinancing costs (y-intercept) and inflation
	rate on the number of months before refinancing can result
	in a profit are shown:

<h2>Equity Buildup Proof</h2>
<p> The equity gained each month is due to the amount
  of principal repayed (i.e. difference between principal remaining
  between month m and m+1) and due to exposure to
  inflation/deflation of the remaining liability.
</p>
<img src="single-month-equity.png">
<p> Equity buildup uses the same mortgage equations proved for the
  <a href="mortgage-calculator.html">mortgage calculator</a>,
  except the loan period 'N' is replaced by a number of 'm' months
  owned. 'P0' is initial loan principal, 'p' the monthly payment,
  and 'r' the monthly interest multiplication factor.
</p>

<p> The sum of nominal gains over n months '&Delta;En':
</p>
<img src="equity-buildup-proof.png">
<p> Finally, if the mortgage is refinanced or sold before its
	term ends, there is a transaction cost 'C' which consumes some
	of the equity gained. This addition limits the model to working
	best when the inflation is &leq; mortgage rates.

<h2>Octave Optimum-Point Function</h2>
<pre>
function months = months_eq_equity_buildup(apr, ipr, coverp, N, n)
  inf = realpow(1+ipr/100, 1/12);
  r = realpow(1+apr/100, 1/12);
  c1 = (r-inf)/(1-1/r);
  c2 = (r^(-N))/(1-1/r);
  months = n - c1*(n-c2*(r^n - 1)) - coverp*inf^n;
endfunction

function buildup = buildup_array(apr, ipr, coverp, N)
  m = 0;
  do
    m = m + 1;
    buildup(m) = months_eq_equity_buildup(apr, ipr, coverp, N, m);
  until(m == N)
endfunction

function opt_point = optimum_point(apr, ipr, coverp, N)
  derivative_zero = buildup_array(apr, ipr, coverp, N);
  r = (1 + apr/100)^(1/12);
  inf = (1 + ipr/100)^(1/12);
  derivative_zero = derivative_zero .- 2*(1+(r - inf)/(1 - 1/r));
  n = 1 + lookup(derivative_zero, 0);
  buildup = months_eq_equity_buildup(apr, ipr, coverp, N, n);
  c = (1 - r^(-N))/(1-1/r);
  annual_yield_multiplier = (1+buildup/c)^(12/n);
  annual_div = 100*(annual_yield_multiplier - 1);
  opt_point = [n, buildup, annual_div];
endfunction
