<h1>Historically Underrepresented Demographic Targeted in Upcoming Election</h1>
<h2>06 SEP 2018</h2>
<p> Following the accidental release of
	<a href="booker-kavanaugh-emails.pdf">Republican-classified documents by a
	Democratic Senator showing the Republican nominee for Supreme Court is
	not racist</a>, politicians and strategists from across the aisle are
	scrambling to target a historically underrepresented group ahead of the 2018
	election: literate people. Literate people are people who can read and write.
</p>
<p> "Literate people have never had a voice in this country", says Democratic
	strategist Data D. Dumbfoundly, noting recent research that
	suggests the founding fathers were illiterate and Abraham Lincoln was actually
	just a notarist who liked stamping thing, like the confederacy.
</p>
<p>"But today the country is shifting,
  buoyed by immigrants coming here and striving to learn English at accelerated
	rates and by the youth, who as early as age 2 are learning to form
	sentences and write college entrance essays. What we really don't understand
	though, is who these voters <em>are</em>, what drives them when they vote
	and how to target them."
</p>
</p>
<p> Republican strategists meanwhile have been targeting literate voters with mail.
	"What we do is we mail them a mailer via mail or email, then we assume
	that they can read what we can write, so we know that all of our party is
	literate" said Republican campaign staffer Dusty Rhodes, "its a new take on
	an old idea with the internet."
</p>
<p> Democrats, on the other hand, are developing their own tech stack and
	database from social media and other data sources and forming graphs of
	voter literacy by QUERY category.
	"Intersectionally speaking, literate people vote overwhelming Democrat", says
	strategist Data D. Dumbfoundly, "its really about getting these people out
	to the polls and we have the largest and most sophisticated operation for
	tracking socially literate and illiterate people in a non-invasive way. And
	by the way, we will continue to fight Republican efforts at every
	level to supress the vote by instituting 'literacy tests' at the polls.
	For example recent academic research, as reported by the
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/01/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-adult-literacy-crisis/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2e7f80ed2886">
	Washington Post</a>, concludes 'If you are reading this, then by definition
	you don’t have a problem that more than 20 percent of the adults in the
	nation’s capital struggle with every day: illiteracy.'
	Obviously this is a fact and we also need to improve our text-free
	messaging, as data suggests as many as 50% of these illiterate adults
	broke for Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton at the polls."
</p>
<p> Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, the former of whom is often credited with
	pioneering data efforts and summoning dramatic effort for each expression
	he composes and speaks, and the latter of whom famously connects a
	Markov Chain generator to his twitter account periodically to generate
	consistent blocks of text, have both weighed in on the matter.
</p>
<p>
	"It is not just literacy on paper. We stopped writing in cursive a decade ago,
	together we can learn to write on the computer today. Our kids need to learn
	computer programming literacy too. Regular literacy is no longer enough.
	Personally I use Haskell and Go because I like their purity" said Mr. Obama.
</p>
<p> When asked whether computer literacy was important like English literacy,
	Mr. Trump said "I write very BIG, very capital code. The
	most beautiful code you have ever seen, many people tell me. I love
	compile option -Wall."
</p>
<hr>
<p> But seriously, I am happy to know with certainty that Judge
	Kavanaugh is not racially biased. The
	<a href="booker-kavanaugh-emails.pdf">leaked documents</a>
	are almost as short as all the news articles.
