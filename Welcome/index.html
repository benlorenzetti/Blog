<h1>Welcome Friends!</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ben and welcome to my space.
I will share with you thoughts on my mind and my goals.
I hope you enjoy my blog, enjoy it and teach me when I'm
wrong, or enjoy it so much you start your own! [<a href="#note-1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>Here's what you need to know:
<ol>
	<li>I'm an engineering student at the University of Cincinnati.
	I think it should be called engineering, not electrical engineering.</li>
	<li>I'm cutting-edge, because I texted via phone before people
    texted via phone (see below).</li>
	<li>I am on book 5 in <em>A Song of Fire and Ice</em>.
	If I ever write a feudal fantasy series, it will be titled
        <em>Sandarac</em>.
    </li>
	<li>One day, I hope to free the world from the limitations of
        current condiment dispensing technology.
    </li>
	<li>Dayton should really be generating hydroelectric power from
        its conservancy dams. What a waste.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>What autobiographical info should you write about yourself on your
own web space book? I have never been very good with electronic identity
and communication.</p>

<p>For my 8th birthday Mom, Dad, and the grandparentals
colluded to give me Pokemon Red with a Game Boy Color.
In a fit of creativity, I named my character Ben.
Even worse, my rival and starter were named "???" and "UNKNOWN" because I
took naming prompts very literally.
[<a id="footnote-2" href="#note-2">2</a>]</p>

<p>Somewhat later (UNKNOWN was definitely level 100) was a formative event
for any teenage boy&mdash;calling your girlfriend while everyone in the kitchen
eavesdrops. At that time Ohio provided a voice-text telephony service
for the deaf. Basically I would speak to a grown man in Columbus and he
was responsible for typing what I said, reading her words, and using a
judging tone. This was also my first experience with semantic control words,
preparing me well for LaTex and digital writing.
&lt;/wait&gt;, \holdon{},
&lt;/no wait, please delete that, yes wait \holdon{}&gt;.
&lt;!--OH GOODNESS DON'T TYPE THAT!--&gt; STOP!
I would have definitely prefered morse code.
</p>

<p>Even "Hello World" programs are difficult. My edition of K&amp;R
C uses that phrase. Has there been no creativity in computer
introductions since then? Were those Alexa's first words?
I tried to be creative with my <a href="">AVR hello world</a>
...but effort that definitely went overboard.
</p>

<p>What is our online identity meant to be?
When you don't know, plaster over it with humor.
One thing is certain, our mental sanity needs to be considered.
</p>

<p>Smell ya later,<br/>Ben</p>

<p id="note-1">[1] In fact, I really hope you start your own website and
that it becomes easier to do so. I am not on Facebook as a political
statement for privacy, identity, and independence, but it is kind of
lonely not being able to follow my friends.
</p>
<p id="note-2">[<a href="#footnote-2">2</a>] Much to my chagrin, neither
Pokemon nor life have a naming guru for people.</p>
